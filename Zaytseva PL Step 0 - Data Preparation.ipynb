       "[\"so I don't want to cry in this video because I cried the other day if I can't guarantee that I won't cry generally thank you very much for coming to Cambridge for an interview for the graduate course in medicine this year before color bla bla bla bla bla bla after detailed consideration I'm very sorry to say that we are not able to make you an offer yeah I applied and I didn't get in that email came in to me and the other day what day he came in on Thursday I feel fine I'm not trying these things online why Holi we haven't even got a few minutes into the video and we're crying oh my gosh right stop oh right breathe I had stuff to say in this video I can't be crying no oh for those of you that have been following my application I'm Madison so over the summer I did work experience and then I was about sure as to whether I was going to apply but in the end I decided that I was just gonna make quite a last-minute application and just see how it goes I didn't want to overburden myself or loads into you so I was like I'll just apply for one University this year and give it my best shot and see what the outcome is and yeah and the outcome is I haven't been successful I haven't got a place you can see why not a t-shirt under this that's fine in my head it's not fine but it will be fine I'm telling myself it's gonna be fine I'll eventually come to terms with it but right now it's still a bit like touchy-feely clearly fully stopped it came in as an email I knew it would come in as an email because everything was happening by email it just pinged in and I saw I recognized the person that sends it you've all smells like oh my gosh there is I was just in the middle of walking I think on Thursday today and I read it and yeah it was like a very quick decision it's been made and not even two weeks I'm kind of bad in a way I didn't really want it to drag on yeah I got upset I sent a message to Mum and everyone at home and I spoke to them I was in tears yes like I am now it was worse the other day yeah I mean facing rejection is hard it's really hot on Thursday I had the fits winter ball with the dance people we were dancing really late till midnight and then the following day so Friday yesterday I had dance as well um I haven't told anyone yet in Cambridge anyway I've told is he just because she's probably one of the closest people I know her and yes I I'm gonna tell people but I didn't want to mention it on Thursday or yesterday just because I knew that it would throw me off and I didn't want it to affect the way I was dancing if I'd have told people I would have gotten upset I would have ruined my makeup day but B I just wanted to like you dance and not really let it get to me and I didn't want to put a downer on us doing fits poor so I didn't tell anyone I just hope you brought home and then I told Izzy the other day I'm more people yes we'll just find out from me putting it on line 24 anything online anyone can see it that's fine I'm not bothered about that but yeah that's why I didn't tell anyone in person straight away and then about the actual email I got because they did give us a bit more information he just stopped sniffing anyway they said the week had got feedback but only in the new year so obviously I will find out where I maybe went wrong or maybe something that I didn't do right or something I needed more of but they said that they had 550 applicants and they offered 41 places I think they said to us on the day of the interview that about 90 to 100 we're given it to you so it's a very big car and it's very competitive the application process you get scored all the way through it's very quantitative which I suppose makes a less objective that's dope they take into account your application so your personal statement which I wrote my new cast my references and I suppose my predicted grades and my grades from fasten second here and a little stuff like that and then 60% of it so the majority of it is based on my interview performance so we had to do alum eyes which is what I had the other week yeah the interviews just scored on a lot of different things they say that each station has scored out of a certain number and then they just add them up by space and they have their 41 places offered they also said that Watkins had a star a a at least available and they said that because of the competition being really high they gave more credit to people that had already graduated with a first class degree as opposed to those that were predicted at first so they did encourage people to reapply so I suppose that as applicable to me because I don't yet have a degree by suppose there may have been other factors like I may have not performed very well and some of the interview stations I don't know because they said that the strongest applicants basically would very good at interview they didn't have very bad scores yeah I might not have done very well and - I mean I didn't have very long to prepare for it I tried to pound a week by me I did my best I did what I could and it just wasn't good enough this year and so I wanted to talk to you guys to not only tell you but I wanted to sit down and tell myself as well as you guys why it's okay I've been rejected and why being rejected it's something that you in there from so as I said at the moment I'm very much like disheartened and I think one of the main reasons is the fact that I kind of tried to put a lot into it when I knew I had it in to I was like okay I'm gonna really give it my shot and I've been working on this like over summer I've been doing a lot of stuff for it I did my personal statement and I just feel like a lot of that work preparing and doing stuff for it it's just time wasted obviously it's not wasted but at the moment I just felt as if I have wasted a lot of time but it's a learning curve and I really need to use it as a learning curve and I need to accept the fact that's okay I've been rejected you know like I shouldn't be sitting here crying I'm annoyed at myself for crying and then same time I'm not upset because I'm just very lost now with life I'm very confused yeah I just I don't know what I'm gonna do now so any more decisions I need to make and I ain't making decisions and I have to just go through the whole process again thinking about my options and all the things I can do and what I really want to do and right now I'm just so confused then I just don't know what I'm gonna do you don't realize how draining these application prices are until you finish and you hear the result when you're like either Wow yes it was worth it or oh great nothing's come from a sort of thing and for me it's don't think that nothing's come from it so now I'm back to square one I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life I'm thinking very pessimistically here right now but when things happens like this you can do anything negatively and it's really hard to see you know the silver lining because every cloud we have to make mistakes we have to do things wrong we have to be rejected to be a better person and I'm kind of glad that something has gone wrong it's gonna make me a better person I know so I'm kind of glad in a way and I was kind of waiting for something like this to happen I was like I need to be rejected or I need to have something bad happened so I'm kind of God yes I took the risk and I just applied to one uni I could have applied to lots more and maybe got a place but I just didn't want to have loads of interviews so I just applied to one so I mean I can't I can only really blame myself and that's fine in terms of what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna have to rethink I kind of want to know what I want to do and I kind of want to have things sorted I mean I say that I would love to have a spontaneous life you know and just go ahead go that but when it comes to it I'm probably not one of those people and I like to have things planned and organized as you guys know with my to-do lists I don't really want to go straight into a job like they can apply next year for Graduate Medical again but it's just the fact that I'm gonna have now and actually yeah and that might be the best year of my life you know like I could trouble I could maybe do a PhD in the meantime which will be three years or I could do a master's or I can maybe a part-time job I don't know or I could maybe go into dance there are so many things I can maybe try and do but right now I'm I just don't know which one of them I should embark on I don't know which is gonna be best I think what's needed there is some soul-searching like I really need to find out what I want to do I really hope this is happened for a good reason you know I kind of believe that things happen for a reason to say there's got to be a reason behind this when other things like this happen I just doubt myself and I'm like I'm not good enough it makes me doubt everything and anything I do and I'm just I'm not good enough and it doesn't make you feel great about yourself being rejected however I don't want to finish this video on a bad note I'm so sorry I've just been crying and sniffing this whole way through like I was super annoying to myself I wanted this video to be you know not wishy-washy but it's been where she washing anyway it's okay essentially that I've been rejected it's fine Holly it's just a rejection on a piece of paper it's so ridiculous I'm gonna be talking probably a lot now about what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna be really trying to think hard about what's gonna be best I hope that any of you guys have also faced rejection I mean I hope that you've got over it and if you are facing a reduction of any kind at the moment that we can relate but it's gonna be okay it's not the end of the world essentially I don't really have anything else to say other than thank you for watching if you mean it to the end of this video then I salute you don't speak to very soon another video that won't be me crying you'll be glad to hear because a life is too short to sit here and cry thanks guys for watching a speech and face [Music] you\",\n",
       " \"hey guys and welcome back to my channel I never thought I would say this but I have done my final year exams five exams in five days wow it was a crazy week and I wanted to take you guys along with me so we started on Monday and this is post exam one is down I'm a fifth of the way through but it's one down oh my gosh breathe calm hello guys I have not spoke to the Cameron so long and I can't even tell you how stressed I have been I've never known Leben this just on FaceTime I've been crying I'm a nervous wreck this morning I was shaking I could not physically stop myself from shaking I don't know why I know what they loved me but these exams have been stressful they are still stressful I am now currently in the middle of like fantasies in my week of exams five days five exam Monday to Friday and I feel a lot better now that I have done one it's so weird you just have to break the ice and do one and then you feel a bit better about them the sooner we start the sooner we finish okay anyway so um let's have an update charts Oh battery's dying already bye oh I have just done my classics I have one of the big like the big ones with two 90 minute questions where I just wrote two essays in this exam I had to choose from three each section how did it go first exam so I don't know it's okay that's but they might always say an exam that's kind of okay my hand kind of hurts now I've got really hot halfway through it just like were ripped off mine on a jumper and pillow saw I was a bit like oh my gosh but yeah it was quite hot in this room but other than that it was it was a semi okay like the first question the first essay I felt okay about I planned it we got it down maybe it's been a bit too long a bit over the time I should've so I moved on to the next section here's the little issue that hiccup we had one of the questions I rolled out straight away I was like no because the last pot depression I was a bit lat well yeah remember to buy shirts and I was like hmm I was like you know in the exam and despair the moment you're best dressed you're like how much one so I decided to do one of that brand it broke the whole introduction okay a whole introduction and then I was just like no no because I didn't think that I had anything extra to put into that essay I like this show it's all focus I'm like an extra reading but yeah I couldn't think of anything because it's quite intricate topic anyway and I was just like no so I read the introduction I kind of waited a bit time helps my issue and then moves on to the other one I didn't really plan other one I just like went straight and was just like you know we're just gonna dive into the deep end and it's had okay but it wasn't so fresh in my brain because they've revised host of our judge my brain is by kind of like throwing some stuff that was extra I thought there was extra so I thought that that would you know like get me a few extra brownie points that was my rationale for radically changing question wasn't like awful I don't thank me I'll say like hopefully not I could have written more like I was more I would like to have said if another but they're like five minutes reading I was like it's to unite de Menezes down now if you today and tour are gonna be the worst days because I have a 9:00 a.m. exam tomorrow so yeah it's kind of like five I'm gonna go to run that's what I'm gonna do because I mean II see a break to get my brain a little bit of a rest and then come back with more forensics arm is the same module so be cancer immunology but it will be a different set up and they'll be like four essays simple to moment essays so they'll be a bit more like specific it sounds like these broad questions I don't know why I'm like doing this so yeah that's my update exam season d1 I couldn't face the camera before this exam because I said I was just so stressed and nervous but what you do want it definitely does something like something clicks and you know okay we're in exam season can't change you just got to do it there's my lovely board still up like in my stress of packing my bag I put in some tissue but then I put in my pencil case and I was like no I can take down to the exams I think I'm cheating I'm I'm not cheating it some last-minute flashcards in D&I me often just like pork and chill Sammy chill before the exam is he and I prefer not to parameter the exam kind of like to give our brains a rest and we've done that for three years and it's kind of worked for us we just character you know calm each other down so we have them it chopped it down when I started my run and so it turned back because it lets you pour down and then a few seconds like got bite widgets dropped all that so I went to the gym and there's some stuff in that bit I'm gonna take them out which is really wet but basically I think if I go find the new topics I'm revising the topics that I have not come up I'm just gonna drop topics now because unlikely that they will ask a similar question that's the P okay that evening was pretty stressful because I knew that I had an exam at 9:00 a.m. the next day but I tried to revise in the most effective way so for me this involves writing things down from memory on scrap pieces of paper using flashcards drilling stuff making sure that I can say it off by heart and in that way I can ensure that it's actually in my brain and I'm not relying on my notes so I just had my folders out and I was going through the topics I felt as if I didn't know about it very well all those I would like to come up in the exam there is currently a thunderstorm and I keep seeing flashes of lightning coming from under my curtains oh my gosh it looks like the scariest thing I've never heard louder Thunder and not gonna lie I'm going to get this undone it's like chucking it down as well I'm currently trying to make overnight so tomorrow because I have 90 M under 24 hours between exams not great like afternoon exam than 90 M and a thunderstorm to go with but yeah [Music] [Music] let's be crates under okay okay second day changed a less good pre-exam breakfast and an apple feeding my brain they just pulled my oats into this bowl and thought it was late to fruit well it's a flaxseed that's me for my morning breakfast exam number two oh my gosh and I've done more than half of my degree more than half because my dissertation I have already done that and it is more than my minor module which I have to work over halfway through just to let you walk to the door and I should just go silly and yes I am wearing the same clothes I will probably be wearing the same place throughout the whole week so yeah I started with my jump up oh this time so I didn't get too hot and that is definitely the way forwards for these next few exams so this one I wrote four essays 45 minutes each which is actually not very long scribbling so hard all right until the end so we picked two questions from each section and I mean they were okay not enough time for right I really wanted just write more and more but you know time constraints I hope it was okay I had my interesting conclusions I didn't plan them because I didn't feel as if I had time and for two of them through the essays I wrote I'd kind of done plans for so I knew the structure I was aiming for which is so great and then the others I was like no we're just gonna dive in and it turned out okay hopefully so just unpack busy bag pencil case and flash baths I didn't look at as always here is the lovely exam paper let's just like not looking at put it somewhere away so my next exam is biochemistry and that's tomorrow afternoon so this is the longest kind of in the war between two exams I don't have any more morning which is so good because that's just a bit of a tight turnaround also the most frustrating thing is that the amount of information that you try and learn okay so there's so much information that I am trying to learn I have my flashcards war there's more stuff here like everything that you try and learn you learn so much and cram it in and the amount that you get to write and you get to go to the examiner that you know the amount that you actually write down on the paper is teeny weeny tiny but yeah I'm gonna phone mum about her nine how it was so I didn't get drenched in the rain today but it was spitting but it was kind of refreshing and then I went to the gym after I'm said my abs and stuff which I'm done in a while so I thought hello abdominal muscles I'm not gonna be making lunch and I'm trying to mix this almond butter because I'm making myself like toasted rye bread I am such a lover of toasted rye bread and when it's a bit burn like random bits of fruit some cucumber you know me I should have everything random in One Bowl if you're a bit confused and you haven't really seen that many of my videos then you might not actually know why study and what I do so I'm going to try and explain I do biology and I take this year a major subject and a minor subject the minor subject in which is what I was revising for this evening is biochemistry and I take one exam in my minor and then find major subject that is in pathology but I do two modules within pathology so one of them is immunology and the other one is cancer and genetic disease it gets even more complicated because the cancer and genetic disease module which I call CJD is split into two parts the first one is cancer II stuff and the second bit is genetics but there is obviously crossover and yeah so I then take for exams and we made for pathology and both have immunology and CTD and I am so tired Wow it has hit me hard I don't know my brain just feels like a massive fog it's not headache but it just feels full like to follow information and I'm just sensing here I'm trying to go through stuff and it's just like not going in I'm just feel as I'm so tired so I think I really just go to bed super early today get up tomorrow my exams in the afternoon and yeah because Wow oh okay three more days there you have to push through and I spoke to dad and he really just need to get sleep unless so dude I need to get sleep I cannot burn out you might have noticed there's this massive thing on the side of my lip it's not food that's not cold or cold slow pulse or I never know what that board anyway it's not one of those it's a cart that essentially won't heal yeah that's beautiful the consoling ah wake up wake up alright so I'm actually going to bed a bit earlier than usual I've been going to bed at about 11:00 every night it's currently like 15 minutes before 11:00 but that's better so I have these kind of like shape things that I use it's again at playing paper but I essentially write down the topic or the exam so this is my biochemistry one and then I write down the things I remember I look at it before I go to bed net hopes cuz it kind of goes into my mind if I look at it just before I go to bed I always have ones like this stuff or like one topic in particular and it's got a bit more information on it but yeah I just like to have these that I can just look up and I find I relate this for yeah [Music] the best happy hump day anyone could ever ask for few topics I'm trying to go over like the majority of topics this morning this is like kind of quickly as I can that's why I kind of try and do before the morning for an exam if I have it in the afternoon the other day I tried to go through like two whole modules in the morning and it just didn't happen but I chemistry there's not that many well there are a few topics but I'm trying to go through quite she doesn't taste quite right yeah I just don't me I'm gonna rest eat in this and then like making myself feel well as much as I hate all throughout exam season and pretty much in general I will drink a smoothie for breakfast and then I usually have oats for lunch especially during exam season and high stress periods I like to have my set meals and my go to so it's a green smoothie and then as you can see at the moment I was mind mapping something so this is just a way to write down everything that I know and focus on the stuff that I maybe don't know so I just like to brainstorm in that way I find wine maps are really useful for essay plans and for trying to organize your notes or organize your thoughts on one topic that is what I was just doing for biochemistry I was trying to go through as much as possible as I said and obviously because my major module has cancer stuff in it there is quite a bit overlap which is really useful so does another exam I've already changed you love just this speaking to mom I was gonna speech you guys before Mike Sam I was a bit rushed and I was already late meeting is I was just like trying to revise like really quickly but didn't even come up in the end yeah the exam it was like hey one question was so broad it was basically like time we get a cancer hello to write an essay now about that I had so much I wanted to say and I got to write like it's much but yeah I try to get as much doubt is the last that ever I don't like scribbling to the end although the questions were like a lot more focused I was how the exam is that you do to that are focused I'm one of those very broad and I'm now done with my chemistry my minor it's done all I have now is two more times left I just think sense freedom oh my gosh and right now I'm already changed to go to the gym it's raining outside again which is super annoying but I'm gonna go to the gym I'm not I come back and guess what I really spoke to you guys this evening but I essentially went to the gym when I got back I've just been revising kind of sense so my exam tomorrow again three hours and the 90-minute assays do we have another 90 minute one for Amy ology and we always have the genetics part module so yeah these questions for the genetics one they tend to be a lot more obscure so a bit worried that they're gonna be really mean but I'm trying not to think negatively I'm just trying to think something like that I dunno stuff I'm telling myself I knew stuff I have mentioned before like the genetic stuff of my CGG module it's not my favorite but like I can't think pessimistically and yeah I'm just got a hope questions are okay so I can write something for 90 minutes which is quite a long time actually the other day both for 90 minutes exams the other day I'm still like I want more time yeah I'm gonna get in the shower now go got more vision I'm going bad I get worried restart day number for an exam number four there we go you know yeah I'm still wearing same jump on it's got to face today new edition I was a bit stressed before this exam bullying that is why I just didn't film anything other than waking up at 6:00 a.m. but yeah this exam okay so I had a slight panic attack when I read the questions I probably had this enough to the genetic stuff as I said and I read the first question and was like what even those I mean that didn't even make sense to me so I moved to the second one and there's a choice of three and I was like what I thought that was not gonna come up because I think similar came at large halls I'm not gonna realize that so I was like no so I moved to the third question I'm thank goodness I could do that one however I was writing the essay I did my plan and they kept doubting myself it's been like is this answering the question I'm sure it was but you don't even the exam sassing and you're just like doubting yourself but I did the essay when obviously I start the exam I also pick the essay that I'm gonna do for me Knology as well I read them really quickly and I was I can't go to through the first one and it was about like bacteria and stuff and vaccines and I was a bit like mm not really feeling that much but if I have to do I'll do it do when I finish the first steps annals I came uh smoother than hat all right the question semiology again second one I was definitely not gonna do because I had no clue how I could write about that for like it in 90 minutes based on what they told us I had no extra reading for as well I read the third one I was like actually my light bulb moment I was like I can do that question and I can actually use stuff that everyone for my designation for it so I was like let's do that so I swapped from doing bacteria to therapeutics and using the immune system which was actually quite good as it's right this toothpaste is very distracting another exam done is the reasonable thing yeah I was really stressed fighting for this one just because the genetic stuff was freaking me out I was so scared and then when I saw that question name I was like gonna cry oh right I'm gonna call mum the usual in my eyes is going about bloodshot I suddenly feel really hay fever II I just went on a run and I was fine until I got back and I was stretching out on the rooftop button and my eyes just started to get really itchy so yeah hey Theo just hold off one more day and then you can come at me full force after every exam whether that be in the morning or in the afternoon I would do some physical form of activity out either go on a run and that was third option if it wasn't raining so that I could get fresh air but otherwise I would then go to the gym it just means I can finish my exam and clear my mind a bit before I then start for the next again I was mind mapping and trying to write stuff down from memory and I did that I did some drills before I then made my dinner so I would every day make all of my food as well in college I didn't go to buttery I've never actually been to buttery in my three years shock horror guys but yeah I did myself loads of vegetative greens which is so important to me and then I was making myself one of my favorite meals which you can probably guess I want you guys to guess what do you think I was making other than the veg it has been a long time since I'm in the kitchen with you guys but anyway I have made myself my dinner it's very typical you probably know it is is this dripping in my food but yeah one of my favorite meals I basically have just been doing like really quick easy meals obviously during exam seasons but still eerily good food to me this is like the best meal of brown rice chickpeas and veg and then over like teeny which seem to land all in this position and that is my dinner memories gloves are dripping also I always add tumeric just over the top and you guys always told me I should mix it and cook it with the food which I am totally aware of I just forget a reasonable time but after he sounds like you focus and think of it more clearly about what I'm doing so just like going into autopilot we've done am eating food which is why I don't do I never thought I would make it this far but Friday the last day [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my god I have

       " \"well former First Lady Michelle Obama thank you for being here to talk with us about your new book thanks for having me the book is called the light we carry overcoming in uncertain times and I have to tell you I read becoming and this is a really different book becoming was obviously this very intimate peeling back the layers of your personal story your family story that I think so many people have wanted to know for so long and but this book is it's more practical it's like a guidebook almost yeah I call it a tool kit I mean I think I'm like everybody over the last few years we have been struggling um you know economic uncertainty a pandemic isolation uh Injustice it's kind of left us all feeling out of sorts and so I get a lot of questions from people it's like how do I cope and given my motto when they go low we go high a lot of people these days have been struggling to figure out how to stay high when it feels like the world is in a low place and so this book is my best attempt at offering people at least an a look into my toolbox the practices and habits the people who keep me balanced and hopefully it'll start a conversation because I think that that's a lot of what we're feeling we've been locked away from one another and we're feeling disconnected and we need to get back together and uncover ourselves with each other and figure out how do we adapt in an inevitably uncertain world one of the things that you said in this book is that when you released becoming several years ago it was like a breath of fresh air after the time that your family spent in the white house so I'm curious to you as you're about to set off on your book tour as you're bringing this book into the world if that was a big breath if that was a release what does this process feel like ah you know whenever you are putting yourself out into the public I am no different it is frightening yeah you know I mean I I talk about in this book how even though becoming was a breath of fresh air There's Something about making yourself vulnerable in the world we may make it look easy but we still go through that doubting process did I share too much um how will people receive the truth that I have to offer um so you know I'm in that same place with uh with this book My Hope Is that people will find something useful in it and I have been I've spent my time alone with this book uh talking with myself and with the few people that I've let look at it now I'm sharing these thoughts do they make sense do they connect with people do they resonate I don't know so that there is still a fear a doubt a vulnerability that goes into any project that I take on um so I'm feeling a little nervous you know what strikes me when I'm reading the book is you get vulnerable not just about yourself but you talk about your marriage we learn about the fact that your daughters are now dating were you you talk about this idea of being comfortably afraid of really being able to harness that fear were you how did you think about the things that you shared with all of us with your readers about your family's lives you know I I always have to strike a balance of how much uh sharing will help people and how do I make sure that I'm protecting my family's privacy um but I think about my writing like I think about everything else I learn from stories um I I never want to produce anything that feels a didactic finger-pointing all I have is my own authentic truth um so I I feel like if I'm coming from that place and I've gotten the permission of my family members then I feel like a okay there's a lesson here so when I talk about my relationship with my husband it's because I know that there are a lot of young people who are trying to figure out how do you what is a marriage how do you shape a relationship I am fascinated by how little we talk to young people young adults about what it actually means to partner with somebody and what those compromises look like and you know pushing them to answer questions for themselves of what are you trying to get out of this relationship with this other person have you thought it through are you seeking a wedding or do you want a relationship those are two very different things so in the chapter that's called partnering well again I share my journey with my husband the things that stuck out for me what I was trying to find in another person and how that worked out over the the course of 30 years we have we are now celebrating our 30th anniversary with the hopes that you know it will create a conversation among the next generation of people trying to start to build their lives what do you look for in a partner what do you have to bring to a relationship yourself in order to make it whole and healthy I got something that so many people are curious about people I think and you've written about this they've idealized your marriage they sit there and look at it but you have always been very clear out and very honest that marriage makes work it takes daily work and that it is not always glamorous and you have had some very unique strains but there's also the strains that any of us who are in a relationship or married face whether it be whose career goes first or who takes on the child care labor how do you think about is there one piece of advice that you would give for people who are thinking about how you put in that work for a partnership that's lasted that yeah it's not really one piece of advice it's to me it's a philosophy it's an Outlook um you know in in this age of we want everything now we want everything quick we you know when life is everything but that um marriage is we have to understand that marriage is never 50 50. um and you know you sort of wonder how that idea kind of got out there um I have found that if you stick with it you know over the course of your entire relationship you may have 50 50 over time but if I look over my marriage if I were to judge it in year five or year 10 there was never 50 50. somebody was always giving way more someone always needed a different kind of thing you have to evolve with it and so yeah yeah there were times when I felt like I was 70 percent in and he was doing 30 percent um but I think that and and I've had to compromise uh as he has I've had to because of the choices that I made in the terms of how I wanted our family to look I had to take my foot off of my career gas pedal uh never putting on the break but slowing up a little bit um those are the natural compromises that are required and I feel bad when I see young people giving up on their relationships because there's there are periods of hard there are periods of discomfort um as I have told young people who ask me about marriage I was like you have to be prepared to have long stretches of discomfort and long I mean it could last for years and don't put kids into the equation because that's just another layer of complication you love them to death but they will shake take your marriage up and turn you both upside down so I think it's important for us to be honest in those conversations not to glamorize what a partnership feels like because then young people quit too soon they quit before they've really you know played out the full scenario so one of the things that I loved that was a through line that ran throughout this book is the the revolving relationships between parents and children and particularly mothers and daughters and you wrote a lot about your relationship with your mom who we all know played a pivotal role with living with your family during your years in the white house I'm curious what has that been like for me as your relationship has evolved into being both adults now having adult children what does that look like for me I think it's a beautiful Journey you know um one of the things I share some of the you know sort of uh unique brand of wisdom that my my parents brought to their parenting I share that in the book but something I admired about my mother is that you know she had a clear philosophy about parenting which is unusual for somebody of her generation there weren't all the what to expect books and the Doctor Who do you do books on how to parent but there were just some a common sense way that approach that she brought to Parenting but she always talked about she said I'm I'm not raising children I'm raising adults um and so I always had an interestingly open and honest conversation with my parents they encouraged us to talk at an early age to find our voices she made sure we felt heard she made sure that she took our concerns and issues seriously we were never treated as kids should be seen and not heard so when you have that Foundation you know your relationship is always I feel at least with my mother and I've tried to do that with my daughters has been on a steady course of growth but you still have to be ready for your your kids to evolve you know who they are at four and seven is not what and what they need from you is very different from what they need from you as teenagers and then again as young women but if you've laid a foundation of trust and honesty every stage I found is is wonderful it's full it's exciting I don't miss any stage I I loved every stage of parenting my girls but I wouldn't go back to any no of the stages I don't long for the time when they were babies I love that time breastfeeding when you you know you could sit and hold them and look at them forever but now that they're young women you know and now I'm less of a day-to-day manager and more of an advisor there's a there's a freedom to enjoy them as individuals to watch them grow and I think that's been the case for me and my mom as well with your girls though has that been comfortable for you the idea of stepping back from that manager role and letting them lead letting them be the people who make you and your husband as you say weak martinis when you come and visit their apartment that I couldn't stop laughing when I read that you know well that's that it is a hard thing to do to let your kids be um you know in this era of helicopter parenting you know where I think parents are very maybe overly involved in their kids lives um I was raised to be handed my competence early you know my mother raised her as I write in the book she says her job is to put herself out of a job early so she started at a very early age requiring us to be independent you know as early as kindergarten she gave us alarm clocks because she knew that we were capable of getting ourselves up she wanted us to feel the power of our competence so from five years old I was setting an alarm soon thereafter I was walking to school by myself and what that does for a kid when your parent trusts you you know it it it encourages you it tells you that if my mom thinks I can do this then I must be capable and I've tried to instill that same kind of Stand by the gate and watch your kids fly be there for them when they come back let them know that you will be their Advocate but don't step in and try to live their lives for them and so when I see my kids flourishing in that way when I see them owning all their choices and succeeding and failing on their own terms and growing from that process it is one of the most satisfying experiences it is frightening it is frightening to watch your children walk into a brick wall but that's what growth is and you know and too many parents try to stop that process but that's the quickest way for them to learn to learn from owning their mistakes and owning their victories at the same time but you got to get adjusted I mean I talk about how you know when you're letting your kids go you're letting your heart out there in the world that Barack and I kind of do this kind of crazy parent text check-in you know like writing things that are keeping us up at night Barack one one day sent them a text on earthquake preparedness because they now live in LA and it's that's the kind of thing you do as a parent you think uh oh there are earthquakes have I warned them are they prepared so in the middle of the night he's sending some article on a 10-step plan that includes you know getting earthquake training and stocking up on water and the response from one of my daughters was okay which of these things do you think we should do because it's a lot right but that's our own anxiety playing itself out um you know what did I miss you know what more can I feed into you to make sure that you're safe and sound and secure but the truth of the matter is that we we don't control that and as a parent that's a hard thing to come to grips with as your child is you is your child grows up and is out there in that big bad world is that you can prepare and love them all all that you can and you still don't have control there are no guarantees that their life is going to work out and something bad may happen that is the hardest thing about parenting is living with that truth but the alternative is to stop them from growing and that in my view would be the sad outcome if my kids were sitting safe in my basement or in their rooms at home uh with me feeling comforted in the fact that I knew what they were doing and where they were but not owning their own lives I think that would be the sadder outcome so I have to remind myself of that you know when I get the urge to step in uh but that's why I tell people parenting is hard it isn't just hard because it's hard it's hard because it's emotionally you are in your most vulnerable space um now I could go on and on but I do write about a lot of that in the book one of the other things you touch on in the book is you are very open and candid about acknowledging the fact that you have support and you have help and you have had help throughout your life in raising your children and you point find out that any High earning successful women who report to have it all and do it all they've got help so I want to ask you what disservice do we do to people particularly women and caregivers when we don't all acknowledge and aren't as transparent about the fact that we have help especially given that we are coming out of a two to three year period that is exposed so much strain in our caregiving infrastructure in this country well that's the you know the the Trope that we wear as women that we're supposed to be able to do it all um you know and I don't know where that came from you know when I look back on the women in my life you know it was a real necessity you know the the matriarchs of our household did do it all as black women with men whose opportunities were limited because of Jim Crow and segregation you know where a black man was more of a threat so a black woman could you know have a more consistency in their earning potential but still had to hold down the traditional wife and mother role of cooking and child rearing you know if I look back over my personal history I can see where you know that's what was modeled to us that the mothers in our lives did everything you know they mother they worked they took care of the home so we're emulating that particularly as women of color you know that's that's a sign of strength you know so we don't ask for help we are not conditioned to think that that that's not a weakness um so yes I think it's a disservice when those of us who are out here modeling it aren't being real clear about the fact that we are not meant to do this life alone we are not meant I believe we were not meant to parent alone you know the whole concept of a nuclear family you know just me my husband if you're lucky and the kid kids and this is our unit and we live independently that's a fairly new phenomenon to our generation you know for uh decades people have lived in extended family units you know I wrote about that into coming I grew up in a community surrounded by family members I had maternal grandparents around the corner paternal grandparents uh you know down the street we lived above the home of a great aunt we saw each other regularly our families cousins together almost every weekend celebrating birthday parties and and I can't think of a time where I had to have a babysitter because there was just always somebody that was chipping in somebody would pop over you'd go over somebody else's house so now here we sit in our generation many of us have moved away from our family units our communities of support and we're off in some city with a big job still trying to emulate what our our grandparents and grandmothers and fathers did that doesn't work you know you need if you're working outside of the home because we all are working inside of the home you know there is no um shame in in getting support your your kids will value it they will value you being less stressful now the guilty part of that piece if you're a woman who has the resources is that we all know women who don't have that choice so sometimes we hide it because it's like dag how am I talking about a nanny and this and that when I know that there are women my peers my my cousins my who don't have that support they're doing just as much as I'm doing but they can't afford they don't have access to affordable child care they couldn't think of having a nanny you know they don't have flexibility in their work schedule so part of it is that there's a kind of survivor's remorse about what you're able to do but I think we still have to talk about the fact that family units have to be based on a big community of support there is um there is uh nothing particularly Courageous about doing life alone you know um but you know if we if if those of us who are doing it aren't being honest about how hard that is and what it takes to actually get it right then we're mirroring the wrong things for the generation to come and I don't want to do that to my girls you know yeah one of the things that you walk through in the book and you talk about a number of the ways in which your life and the journey that your family has been on has been incredibly exceptional but you also talk about some incredibly relatable experiences such as the isolation of being the only whether it is the only woman of color the only black person in the room of being the only person who didn't come for money at a college and I wonder now all these years later in the journey that you have been on do you still feel that way sometimes and how do you deal with it yeah honestly of course as Michelle Obama you know I feel it less acutely um but that's fairly recent you know I mean when we were in the white house we were the the first and the only at many tables of power um watching people adjust to that um that was very reminiscent of the experiences that I had you know going to college and practicing in a corporate law firm and sitting around board uh seats and on and on and on um but what I found is over time and I write about this is that you know we can't change that reality um we are still sadly breaking barriers right I mean it is unfortunate that uh the percentages of students of color on college campuses is remaining relatively sadly stagnant the same is true and if you look at corporate law the numbers of Associates and partners in large firms has not really significantly increased um so we still are struggling to make progress so in the meantime we're dealing with the reality of the fact that yeah we're still trying to fill those seats so how do we get through in the meantime um because when you're an only there's uh as I describe it there's a a feeling of walking around trying to navigate a a town or a city with a road map that doesn't fit you know you're playing a game with someone else's rules um you feel isolated and disconnected sometimes outside of your own body and what happens when that occurs is that you start feeling self-conscious you spend more time thinking about your loneliness you're carrying that burden rather than focusing on the task at hand and that is that makes overcoming all that just even more difficult um what I had to learn to do was to first get out of my own head not easy though it's not it is not an easy thing to do and it takes practice but part of what this book is reminding us is that there are no Miracle answers to these things overcoming imposter syndrome feeling like you belong right um there isn't a this is these are the three steps you take to feeling seen right doesn't happen that way for me I have practiced trying to get out of my head for 58 years now it is a daily reminder that I have to uh take the mask that I am trying to hold up on my face take it down so that I can see what I'm doing and by mask I mean stop trying to stop pretending to be something that I'm not trying to fit in and leave behind the parts of me that make me real and authentic stop worrying about how I wear my hair and what somebody is going to think about it you know stop thinking about how I conjugate my verbs or what stories I tell about myself to make me fit into somebody else's world that gets in we get in our way with that but it takes practice and I open the book by urging young people to read it to understand that patience is an important tool in in developing your own set of tools what I am able to do now the messages that I tell myself now at 58 are very different than what I needed to say to myself at 20. but I know now have a lifetime of understanding that I have been practicing through being the only of quieting my doubtful mind and then speaking up and using my experiences as the source code as I say to the power that I actually have and bring you know it doesn't happen overnight but we have to keep telling ourselves I am going to show up in the world as my authentic self and that is good enough that's the work that we have to do I wish there were shortcuts um but it is what it is you mentioned patience and that is something that I've been wanting to ask you about you mentioned earlier the call to action that many of us know you for when they go low we go high and in a past life before I had this job I was a political correspondent and I spent a lot of time traveling this country and talking to young people in particular and what I heard a lot and I'm sure you hear this too from the people who write you letters or come to events that you hold is the fact that they want to believe in a world of going high but they feel a sense of urgency oftentimes they express that they feel a sense of Rage given all of the hurt and harm and marginalization the Insurrection attacks on lgbtq rights anti-Semitism I could the list the laundry list could go on how does going high square with the urgency that so many people feel especially young people feel In This Moment well that's the interesting thing because young people interpret some young people interpret going high as being complacent you know going going high doesn't mean sitting on the side of the road and watching you know Injustice go by going high is about having a strategy a real concrete strategy for change it's taking the rage and turning it into reason so that you can actually be heard and move toward change so when I think about going high I'm usually thinking at a time when I'm feeling the rage and I feel the need to react I I've learned to ask myself am I indulging my rage is what I'm about to do or say gonna make me feel good in the short term but have no impact over the long term right because the goal is the impact ultimately you know um that's what Barack and I had to do every day in the White House you know I used to play this game with my communication staff before an interview or something where we would sort of walk through the questions and there'd be some question that would be what I call a knucklehead question you know and I'd I'd practice my true response right my I shouldn't say true my gut response because sometimes just playing it out loud helps to get it out but then when you put your your first gut reaction out there for the world to see in here and then you look at it for a minute and you go ah well that's not even how I really feel you know um and what's going to be the outcome you know there's going to be half the country that won't even hear the rest of the the solution if I start there if I start with my rage and anger all I will do is play out my rage and anger but I won't be able to affect any change going high is about the ultimate goal of where are we trying to go and what's the best way to get there and over the course of history especially the history of civil rights there was the rage but there was always the plan you know the March on Washington was the cherry on top after Decades of legislative action and strategic sit-downs you know the March wasn't the it wasn't the beginning or the end and that's what we have to figure out what is the true beginning and where are we trying to get to there is room for rage in that you know there's there's and there's urgency in that the other thing I try to remind young people is that um it's easy to look at what your press predecessors have done and to say not enough why not why not faster why not better why not bigger and what I say is young people aren't wrong to feel that that's that's why folks need to get out of the way and pass on you know pass on the power to the Next Generation but what we can't lose sight of is that every generation in this movement toward whatever change they are they are laying the marker that they can at the time they are working within the confines with the doubts in their heads the the history that they come from we do ourselves no good by being mad because the folks aren't our team didn't do more people are doing what they can do with what they have and I can guarantee you that this generation of young people that are complaining about the lack of urgency will get to our age and their kids will look at them and say why'd you do more faster the nature of change it it is a slog it is a marathon and it will never feel like enough because until everything is perfect it will always be urgent but in the meantime what I urge young people to do is be be be rageful you you and own it but have a plan have a strategy that can work um know what it is be thoughtful about that approach and make sure that what you say is really what you mean and how you feel over the long term and not just today you know it strikes me as you write about how imperative it is that we should still go high that we have we're coming out of this period where all of us have faced so many challenges um tomorrow former president Trump is expected to announce that he's going to run for president yet again um and I just wonder you talk about this toolbox what goes through your head and what tools do you reach for when you think about something like that oh i i i and my husband helps me with this I I think about the context of the history of our country of our world and I realize that you know this is a moment this is a moment and we cannot let a moment turn us so upside down that we can't function you know um the the the Arc of change doesn't just go straight up it goes up and down and up and down and so in these moments I tell myself I ask myself and this is a chapter that I I call the power of small all right what can I do in this moment that I can uniquely control when I think something's about to happen that I cannot control right um voting is one of those things you know it doesn't feel like a lot you know it's a small action that happens on a Tuesday uh every couple of years would happen more if people voted more and focused on their local elections too um but that's one of those things you know if you if you don't like the guy that's running the power that we have in our democracy however small it is is that we each have the responsibility and the right to vote at least right now so let us exercise it you know so that we're we're not in a position to take it for granted and have those rights snatched away because let me tell you if we don't if we don't use them if we don't protect them fiercely even when the person who won isn't somebody that we agree with we will lose those rights we've seen it with uh abortion rights we've seen it we've experienced it I can't tell you how many times we got on the campaign Trail over the last eight years and said this election is important you know because the Supreme Court is at risk you know it matters who's on the Supreme Court Roe v Wade is you know is in jeopardy and watching election after election people not turning out you know um because they didn't like that guy they were mad about the fact why is he even running you know and it's not necessarily Trump but anybody right the governor's race the U.S attorney you know we sit out we don't we don't do the work because we're mad about who's in um we have this small power each of us to shape the direction of the country and if we don't use it you know I I mean I I you know I I never want to throw my hands up

       " \"[Music] Karl Marx is often described as one of the greatest thinkers of the 19th century his writings have inspired revolutions and generated centuries of fierce debate born in Prussia now Germany in May 1818 Marx believed that capitalism which was in its infancy at the time had serious flaws Marx claimed that in pursuit of profit capitalists would encourage their ideology that work is good leisure is bad and material things will make us happy embracing mass production depriving workers of job satisfaction at the same time exploiting the working-class he became involved in the communist League a small group of intellectuals who wanted to abolish the class system and spread wealth equally Marx wrote the communist manifesto in 1847 with his benefactor Friedrich Engels laying out the Marxist vision of a society where wealth was distributed evenly property is owned publicly and education is free for all but Marx was little known and little read at the time when he died in 1883 only eleven people attended his funeral after his death his ideas flourished based on the theory of Marxism came communism the realization of a stateless society where all are equal communism became a global movement but the utopian ideal of a fair and equal society failed to materialize communism terrorized and impoverished its subjects and slaughtered them in the tens of millions today capitalism dominates the world but many of Marx's criticisms have never been more relevant today the global disparity between rich and poor is striking Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to the rich getting richer and the poor staying Paul he was right he also predicted that capitalism would lead to boom and bust economics Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to globalization and that a handful of firms would have huge market dominance [Music] however Marx underestimated the ability of capitalism to make everybody richer by making products much cheaper since the 1980s the number of people in absolute poverty has fallen by about 1 billion he also got wrong the capacity of capitalism to reform itself by creating welfare states that redistributed wealth through taxation although there is a lot to learn from Marx his solution was far worse than the disease at the same time it can't be said that today's capitalism dominated by immense inequality and financial crises has triumphed [Music] you\",\n",
       " \"[Music] 2023 a year that many are facing with trepidation and whilst much of the world will be tightening its belt there are plenty of ways in which 2023 is set to challenge assumptions from antique treasures and old-fashioned solutions to psychedelic Revelations and the fate of the world's biggest population here are five stories that may just transform the world ahead [Music] in 2023 the most populous country on the planet will no longer be China but India China's population is peaking while India's has continued to grow and the UN predicts that on April the 14th 2023 India's population will overtake that of China's that is hugely significant in symbolic terms but what's more important is the composition of the Indian population specifically the size of its working age population India has more people of working age than any other population group when this happens it can lead to what's known as a demographic dividend because of the opportunity it offers for economic growth particularly for developing countries take what happened in China a population boom under Mao was followed by the introduction of the one child policy in 1979. this created a big working age population with fewer children to raise providing the Manpower for China's extraordinary economic expansion India's demographic bulge started much later than China's in the 2010s its forecast to continue to around 2050. with the biggest growth in the next decade [Music] is on this opportunity a bigger working age population in theory should mean greater productivity but in India there are obstacles to its success for a start about 90 percent of jobs in India are informal which means the vast majority of workers don't have a regular salary informal sector workers are quite productive the problem is that these are very insecure jobs and so we knew things like kovid happened suddenly many of these workers are out of work so Indian government has been trying to set up some national pension schemes health insurance benefits and so on but Social Security benefits are quite limited for many of these workers what's more just 20 percent of women of working age are actually working part of the problem is that while girls are being educated to a higher level it's often not high enough to work in offices so what for these women in the regime it's quite difficult to find one for men of the same education there are many jobs like truck drivers mobile phone repairers poster delivery workers a lot of these occupations are not really open to women part of China's rapid economic growth was due to the foreign company's factories that were set up there the Indian government has been trying to mimic this with a make in India campaign to entice foreign investment it's had some success in a big boost to India's manufacturing sector Apple says that it plans to make the iPhone 14 in India but the country's infrastructure and the state of its Workforce remain a barrier the proportion of the labor force that has any formal training is extremely small around three percent there's very high level still of malnutrition anemia and other health issues that means that a lot of people coming into the labor force cognitive and physical development may have been impaired the challenge for the Indian government is to create the economic environment to encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to create jobs so that it can reap the rewards of being the most populous country on the planet 2023 could be the year that party drugs get closer to being in your prescriptions with three different psychedelic drugs in Phase 3 trials to treat mental health conditions MDMA could even be approved to treat post-traumatic stress disorder in America 2023 could potentially be a landmark year for us this could be the first psychedelic assisted therapy approved by a regulatory body in any given year around 12 million Americans suffer from PTSD and for some like veteran John lubecky it can last many years he was a participant in a phase II trial run by Maps PBC which has been developing MDMA assisted therapy since 2004. you're experience me it's kind of weird various periods of my life the treatment combines three doses of MDMA followed by Psychotherapy sessions it's not just the MDMA it's not just the therapy it's the two of them working together the results of our first pivotal phase three study thought at 67 percent of the people in the MDMA group no longer met the criteria for having PTSD fmdma does get approved for PTSD in 2023 it will be again for patients who really have limited options at the moment for treating this very difficult and this terrible condition psychedelics like MDMA can make therapy much more effective they can dampen activity in the part of the brain that processes fear and release feel-good hormones and neurotransmitters like serotonin which help reduce anxiety and increase empathy making it easier for a patient to reflect on a traumatic experience psilocybin also known as magic mushrooms will also be in a phase 3 trial of a global study for treatment resistant depression that also has had a successful trial so far after having this therapy 12 weeks later about one in five are in remission a third drug normally associated with nightclubs is also in this critical final stage of testing ketamine-assisted therapy is showing promise in helping with alcohol use disorder in the most recent study 86 percent of patients were still abstained from alcohol six months after treatment already offered at awakens private clinics ketamine could eventually be regulated for General use in Britain we're seeing them being hyped as curals for lots and lots of different mental health conditions and while I'm really excited about their promise I do think it's really important that patients have realistic expectations about what they can achieve but all in all I think what we're looking at is 2023 is going to be a really pivotal year for psychedelic medicines hello I'm Tom standage editor of the world ahead to read about the prospects for the coming year in more detail and get a head start on more of the themes and Trends to watch take out a subscription to The Economist which includes full access to the world ahead 2023 to get the best offer click on the link and now on with the fill in 2023 there's one country which could make a global recession much worse Japan Japan's the third largest economy and it's an important economy because its financial sector is intertwined with the financial sector of the rest of the world Japan is the world's biggest creditor country it holds trillions of dollars of assets overseas which means what happens here has the potential to affect the world's financial markets in recent years Japan's Central Bank the bank of Japan has been reassuring a predictable keeping interest rates low thanks to its very low inflation interest rates only have to go up when inflation Rises and that just hasn't happened so for a long time Japan defied any predictions that it would have to raise interest rates or Titan monetary policy to the extent that betting that it would have to do that was a notorious way to lose money it was a trade called the Widowmaker it was always wrong even in the face of the pandemic and the energy crisis the bank of Japan held fast thank you the bank of Japan increasingly an outlier keeping its overnight interest rate at minus 0.1 percent the dovish tone continues oh boy does it ever that is until now as interest rates have risen elsewhere in the world Japan has found itself exposed by the widening Gap the effect of that has been to make the Japanese currency the Yen less attractive to International investors because if you buy the Yen and invest in the Japanese bond market you're getting a lower interest rate lower return than if you invest in the U.S treasury market say where you can benefit from those higher interest rates as a result the Yen has fallen against the dollar making Imports more expensive for Japan which pushed up the rate of inflation so at the end of 2022 the bank of Japan did something unexpected it was all to do with the interest rate known as the yield on one particular form of Japanese government debt its 10-year bond the yield on this bond is crucial in Japan because it affects a lot of economic activity often borrowing by companies mortgages and all kinds of contracts are related to long-term interest rates so the idea is by keeping those interest rates low you stimulate spending and growth in the economy the Japanese Central Bank has certainly done that by capping the yield of its 10-year bonds at 0.25 percent the yield of a long-term Bond moves in the opposite direction to its price so in order to keep the cap in place the bank of Japan has been buying as many bonds as necessary but in December 2022 the bank of Japan increased the cap to 0.5 percent it might seem a relatively small move but it was enough to destabilize the markets Global markets were jolted overnight after the bank of Japan unexpectedly widened its cap on 10-year Japanese government bond yields and it was also an indication that in 2023 the bank of Japan might go even further the question is how much further it could ditch the cap completely but it could also start to increase short-term interest rates too as other central banks have done already what's happened in 2022 is that central banks around the world and most importantly America's federal reserve have been raising interest rates and what that's meant is that there's been a growing gap between interest rates in Japan and in the rest of the world the Federal Reserve for example has increased interest rates from 0.25 percent at the start of 2022 to 4.5 percent at the end but if interest rates in Japan climb the same distance in 2023 it would be much more concerning because Japan has the highest level of public debt of any rich country while interest rates were low high public debt was manageable but if interest rates rise investors will start to worry that Japan might not be able to service its debt and start to sell their bonds causing bond yields to go up Suddenly It's going to be more expensive for companies and for individuals to borrow if there's a dramatic repricing in rates that can be quite destabilizing for the economy and because Japan is so intertwined with the rest of the world this destabilization could spread to other financial markets which means what the bank of Japan chooses to do in 2023 could make any Global recession much worse [Music] foreign [Music] it'll be back to the future for the fashion industry as make do and mend we'll be back on trend big clothing brands won't just be selling new clothes but perhaps surprisingly also encouraging more wear out of old items too Tommy Hilfiger Hugo Boss and lvmh the world's biggest luxury group are all set to launch their own repair and resale services in 2023 it will all be part of a wider push towards a more eco-friendly fashion industry today we are making more clothes than ever before but we're using them less pretty much the entire fashion industry operates under the same model increasing throughput and number of Seasons very very limited clothing is actually designed to be remade repaired reused or recycled every second the equivalent of a rubbish truck of textiles is burnt or buried in landfill one way to eliminate waste and pollution is through what is known as a circular economy essentially keeping products in use for longer [Music] save your wardrobe is a new digital business that has spotted an opportunity to do just that it buttons up so tight that we're going to make it a cropped jacket so it's going to just above the pockets growing up in Tunisia I was really passionate about seeing how local tailors were able super fast to create new things or repair things and coming to Europe I realized that it was all replaced by fast behaviors of purchasing I thought let's explore this opportunity using the app customers can transform their worn out wardrobes everything about severe wardrobe started because I loved seeing things remade again and again our recent research shows that things like circular business models like resale rental repair and remaking have the possibility to be 23 of the global fashion industry by 2030 which represents a market opportunity of 700 billion US dollars [Music] but there is a risk to all this Brands could use repair services as green washing without actually helping the planet if an organization is offering a service like repair but to use that service they'll give you a voucher off their traditional linear sales this is incentivizing growth of their linear business model rather than actually mainstream transition to a circular economy for that business any claims that organizations are making should be really specific and should have very clear definitions attached thank you on May the 6th 2023 Charles III will be crowned King of the United Kingdom while all eyes will be on him some may glance at his wife Camilla and especially what she chooses to wear on her head it's said that he wants queen Camilla to wear the crown that his grandmother wore at her coronation in 1937. at the center of that Crown sits the Kohinoor diamond which was taken from India in 1849 was presented to Queen Victoria but the idea that this was any real way a gift very much in dispute if she wears it one expert has said that for Indians this would be a massive diplomatic grenade in 2023 the Crown's Colonial passed will add fuel to broader debate over the repatriation of artifacts taken from other countries the movement in favor of restitution is becoming increasingly strong people should be allowed to see the art of their own countries in their own countries Glasgow life museums will be the first in Britain to return artifacts to India all seven objects will be going back to New Delhi and they have a museum which is devoted to the display of confiscated or returned artifacts our aspiration is to develop strong contemporary Partnerships across the world we don't think that's possible if we continue to retain objects to which we don't have legal or or moral title and so part of the process is to address some of these these These past mistakes and to to rectify them the Indian artifacts aren't the only items being sent home Glasgow is also returning Benin bronzes part of a wider campaign to repatriate these artifacts to what is now Nigeria the national commission for Museum and monuments of Nigeria are acting on behalf of the Uber of Benin they're trying to build a facility to house all of the returning bronzers thousands of bronzers were looted from Benin City when British troops invaded in 1897. is an artist who is part of the campaign to repatriate them to Nigeria collectively the Formby Encyclopedia of our history of our culture so in taking them away and locking them involved in various museums all over the world except in Africa it creates a void we can't access as a people the truths which our ancestors have encoded other collections in Britain and around the world have also approved returning bronzes but restitution remains a controversial subject the objects may be seen is just simply walk some art and therefore why is there a need to return them but their spiritual and cultural significance is uh often way more important and if one recognizes that then the return of the object becomes an obvious step to take there are numerous items in museums across the world that are wanted back by their country of origin among the most infamous are the Parthenon marbles many of which have been on display in the British museum for two centuries a Greek newspaper has revealed the museum has been in talks about their possible return but there are many legal barriers to restitution often making it a political decision rather than one solely for the museum trustees which means it remains to be seen whether the Parthenon marbles the Indian Kohinoor diamond or indeed any other artifacts might make their way home 2023 is going to be a huge year for this expect movement on requests from Egypt from Ethiopia from Ghana from the Pacific Islands from Easter Island from Latin America for things to be returned this is not going to stop here thank you for watching to read more of our coverage of what might be coming in 2023 click the link and don't forget

       "[\"so I don't want to cry in this video because I cried the other day if I can't guarantee that I won't cry generally thank you very much for coming to Cambridge for an interview for the graduate course in medicine this year before color bla bla bla bla bla bla after detailed consideration I'm very sorry to say that we are not able to make you an offer yeah I applied and I didn't get in that email came in to me and the other day what day he came in on Thursday I feel fine I'm not trying these things online why Holi we haven't even got a few minutes into the video and we're crying oh my gosh right stop oh right breathe I had stuff to say in this video I can't be crying no oh for those of you that have been following my application I'm Madison so over the summer I did work experience and then I was about sure as to whether I was going to apply but in the end I decided that I was just gonna make quite a last-minute application and just see how it goes I didn't want to overburden myself or loads into you so I was like I'll just apply for one University this year and give it my best shot and see what the outcome is and yeah and the outcome is I haven't been successful I haven't got a place you can see why not a t-shirt under this that's fine in my head it's not fine but it will be fine I'm telling myself it's gonna be fine I'll eventually come to terms with it but right now it's still a bit like touchy-feely clearly fully stopped it came in as an email I knew it would come in as an email because everything was happening by email it just pinged in and I saw I recognized the person that sends it you've all smells like oh my gosh there is I was just in the middle of walking I think on Thursday today and I read it and yeah it was like a very quick decision it's been made and not even two weeks I'm kind of bad in a way I didn't really want it to drag on yeah I got upset I sent a message to Mum and everyone at home and I spoke to them I was in tears yes like I am now it was worse the other day yeah I mean facing rejection is hard it's really hot on Thursday I had the fits winter ball with the dance people we were dancing really late till midnight and then the following day so Friday yesterday I had dance as well um I haven't told anyone yet in Cambridge anyway I've told is he just because she's probably one of the closest people I know her and yes I I'm gonna tell people but I didn't want to mention it on Thursday or yesterday just because I knew that it would throw me off and I didn't want it to affect the way I was dancing if I'd have told people I would have gotten upset I would have ruined my makeup day but B I just wanted to like you dance and not really let it get to me and I didn't want to put a downer on us doing fits poor so I didn't tell anyone I just hope you brought home and then I told Izzy the other day I'm more people yes we'll just find out from me putting it on line 24 anything online anyone can see it that's fine I'm not bothered about that but yeah that's why I didn't tell anyone in person straight away and then about the actual email I got because they did give us a bit more information he just stopped sniffing anyway they said the week had got feedback but only in the new year so obviously I will find out where I maybe went wrong or maybe something that I didn't do right or something I needed more of but they said that they had 550 applicants and they offered 41 places I think they said to us on the day of the interview that about 90 to 100 we're given it to you so it's a very big car and it's very competitive the application process you get scored all the way through it's very quantitative which I suppose makes a less objective that's dope they take into account your application so your personal statement which I wrote my new cast my references and I suppose my predicted grades and my grades from fasten second here and a little stuff like that and then 60% of it so the majority of it is based on my interview performance so we had to do alum eyes which is what I had the other week yeah the interviews just scored on a lot of different things they say that each station has scored out of a certain number and then they just add them up by space and they have their 41 places offered they also said that Watkins had a star a a at least available and they said that because of the competition being really high they gave more credit to people that had already graduated with a first class degree as opposed to those that were predicted at first so they did encourage people to reapply so I suppose that as applicable to me because I don't yet have a degree by suppose there may have been other factors like I may have not performed very well and some of the interview stations I don't know because they said that the strongest applicants basically would very good at interview they didn't have very bad scores yeah I might not have done very well and - I mean I didn't have very long to prepare for it I tried to pound a week by me I did my best I did what I could and it just wasn't good enough this year and so I wanted to talk to you guys to not only tell you but I wanted to sit down and tell myself as well as you guys why it's okay I've been rejected and why being rejected it's something that you in there from so as I said at the moment I'm very much like disheartened and I think one of the main reasons is the fact that I kind of tried to put a lot into it when I knew I had it in to I was like okay I'm gonna really give it my shot and I've been working on this like over summer I've been doing a lot of stuff for it I did my personal statement and I just feel like a lot of that work preparing and doing stuff for it it's just time wasted obviously it's not wasted but at the moment I just felt as if I have wasted a lot of time but it's a learning curve and I really need to use it as a learning curve and I need to accept the fact that's okay I've been rejected you know like I shouldn't be sitting here crying I'm annoyed at myself for crying and then same time I'm not upset because I'm just very lost now with life I'm very confused yeah I just I don't know what I'm gonna do now so any more decisions I need to make and I ain't making decisions and I have to just go through the whole process again thinking about my options and all the things I can do and what I really want to do and right now I'm just so confused then I just don't know what I'm gonna do you don't realize how draining these application prices are until you finish and you hear the result when you're like either Wow yes it was worth it or oh great nothing's come from a sort of thing and for me it's don't think that nothing's come from it so now I'm back to square one I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life I'm thinking very pessimistically here right now but when things happens like this you can do anything negatively and it's really hard to see you know the silver lining because every cloud we have to make mistakes we have to do things wrong we have to be rejected to be a better person and I'm kind of glad that something has gone wrong it's gonna make me a better person I know so I'm kind of glad in a way and I was kind of waiting for something like this to happen I was like I need to be rejected or I need to have something bad happened so I'm kind of God yes I took the risk and I just applied to one uni I could have applied to lots more and maybe got a place but I just didn't want to have loads of interviews so I just applied to one so I mean I can't I can only really blame myself and that's fine in terms of what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna have to rethink I kind of want to know what I want to do and I kind of want to have things sorted I mean I say that I would love to have a spontaneous life you know and just go ahead go that but when it comes to it I'm probably not one of those people and I like to have things planned and organized as you guys know with my to-do lists I don't really want to go straight into a job like they can apply next year for Graduate Medical again but it's just the fact that I'm gonna have now and actually yeah and that might be the best year of my life you know like I could trouble I could maybe do a PhD in the meantime which will be three years or I could do a master's or I can maybe a part-time job I don't know or I could maybe go into dance there are so many things I can maybe try and do but right now I'm I just don't know which one of them I should embark on I don't know which is gonna be best I think what's needed there is some soul-searching like I really need to find out what I want to do I really hope this is happened for a good reason you know I kind of believe that things happen for a reason to say there's got to be a reason behind this when other things like this happen I just doubt myself and I'm like I'm not good enough it makes me doubt everything and anything I do and I'm just I'm not good enough and it doesn't make you feel great about yourself being rejected however I don't want to finish this video on a bad note I'm so sorry I've just been crying and sniffing this whole way through like I was super annoying to myself I wanted this video to be you know not wishy-washy but it's been where she washing anyway it's okay essentially that I've been rejected it's fine Holly it's just a rejection on a piece of paper it's so ridiculous I'm gonna be talking probably a lot now about what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna be really trying to think hard about what's gonna be best I hope that any of you guys have also faced rejection I mean I hope that you've got over it and if you are facing a reduction of any kind at the moment that we can relate but it's gonna be okay it's not the end of the world essentially I don't really have anything else to say other than thank you for watching if you mean it to the end of this video then I salute you don't speak to very soon another video that won't be me crying you'll be glad to hear because a life is too short to sit here and cry thanks guys for watching a speech and face  you\",\n",
       " \"hey guys and welcome back to my channel I never thought I would say this but I have done my final year exams five exams in five days wow it was a crazy week and I wanted to take you guys along with me so we started on Monday and this is post exam one is down I'm a fifth of the way through but it's one down oh my gosh breathe calm hello guys I have not spoke to the Cameron so long and I can't even tell you how stressed I have been I've never known Leben this just on FaceTime I've been crying I'm a nervous wreck this morning I was shaking I could not physically stop myself from shaking I don't know why I know what they loved me but these exams have been stressful they are still stressful I am now currently in the middle of like fantasies in my week of exams five days five exam Monday to Friday and I feel a lot better now that I have done one it's so weird you just have to break the ice and do one and then you feel a bit better about them the sooner we start the sooner we finish okay anyway so um let's have an update charts Oh battery's dying already bye oh I have just done my classics I have one of the big like the big ones with two 90 minute questions where I just wrote two essays in this exam I had to choose from three each section how did it go first exam so I don't know it's okay that's but they might always say an exam that's kind of okay my hand kind of hurts now I've got really hot halfway through it just like were ripped off mine on a jumper and pillow saw I was a bit like oh my gosh but yeah it was quite hot in this room but other than that it was it was a semi okay like the first question the first essay I felt okay about I planned it we got it down maybe it's been a bit too long a bit over the time I should've so I moved on to the next section here's the little issue that hiccup we had one of the questions I rolled out straight away I was like no because the last pot depression I was a bit lat well yeah remember to buy shirts and I was like hmm I was like you know in the exam and despair the moment you're best dressed you're like how much one so I decided to do one of that brand it broke the whole introduction okay a whole introduction and then I was just like no no because I didn't think that I had anything extra to put into that essay I like this show it's all focus I'm like an extra reading but yeah I couldn't think of anything because it's quite intricate topic anyway and I was just like no so I read the introduction I kind of waited a bit time helps my issue and then moves on to the other one I didn't really plan other one I just like went straight and was just like you know we're just gonna dive into the deep end and it's had okay but it wasn't so fresh in my brain because they've revised host of our judge my brain is by kind of like throwing some stuff that was extra I thought there was extra so I thought that that would you know like get me a few extra brownie points that was my rationale for radically changing question wasn't like awful I don't thank me I'll say like hopefully not I could have written more like I was more I would like to have said if another but they're like five minutes reading I was like it's to unite de Menezes down now if you today and tour are gonna be the worst days because I have a 9:00 a.m. exam tomorrow so yeah it's kind of like five I'm gonna go to run that's what I'm gonna do because I mean II see a break to get my brain a little bit of a rest and then come back with more forensics arm is the same module so be cancer immunology but it will be a different set up and they'll be like four essays simple to moment essays so they'll be a bit more like specific it sounds like these broad questions I don't know why I'm like doing this so yeah that's my update exam season d1 I couldn't face the camera before this exam because I said I was just so stressed and nervous but what you do want it definitely does something like something clicks and you know okay we're in exam season can't change you just got to do it there's my lovely board still up like in my stress of packing my bag I put in some tissue but then I put in my pencil case and I was like no I can take down to the exams I think I'm cheating I'm I'm not cheating it some last-minute flashcards in D&I me often just like pork and chill Sammy chill before the exam is he and I prefer not to parameter the exam kind of like to give our brains a rest and we've done that for three years and it's kind of worked for us we just character you know calm each other down so we have them it chopped it down when I started my run and so it turned back because it lets you pour down and then a few seconds like got bite widgets dropped all that so I went to the gym and there's some stuff in that bit I'm gonna take them out which is really wet but basically I think if I go find the new topics I'm revising the topics that I have not come up I'm just gonna drop topics now because unlikely that they will ask a similar question that's the P okay that evening was pretty stressful because I knew that I had an exam at 9:00 a.m. the next day but I tried to revise in the most effective way so for me this involves writing things down from memory on scrap pieces of paper using flashcards drilling stuff making sure that I can say it off by heart and in that way I can ensure that it's actually in my brain and I'm not relying on my notes so I just had my folders out and I was going through the topics I felt as if I didn't know about it very well all those I would like to come up in the exam there is currently a thunderstorm and I keep seeing flashes of lightning coming from under my curtains oh my gosh it looks like the scariest thing I've never heard louder Thunder and not gonna lie I'm going to get this undone it's like chucking it down as well I'm currently trying to make overnight so tomorrow because I have 90 M under 24 hours between exams not great like afternoon exam than 90 M and a thunderstorm to go with but yeah   let's be crates under okay okay second day changed a less good pre-exam breakfast and an apple feeding my brain they just pulled my oats into this bowl and thought it was late to fruit well it's a flaxseed that's me for my morning breakfast exam number two oh my gosh and I've done more than half of my degree more than half because my dissertation I have already done that and it is more than my minor module which I have to work over halfway through just to let you walk to the door and I should just go silly and yes I am wearing the same clothes I will probably be wearing the same place throughout the whole week so yeah I started with my jump up oh this time so I didn't get too hot and that is definitely the way forwards for these next few exams so this one I wrote four essays 45 minutes each which is actually not very long scribbling so hard all right until the end so we picked two questions from each section and I mean they were okay not enough time for right I really wanted just write more and more but you know time constraints I hope it was okay I had my interesting conclusions I didn't plan them because I didn't feel as if I had time and for two of them through the essays I wrote I'd kind of done plans for so I knew the structure I was aiming for which is so great and then the others I was like no we're just gonna dive in and it turned out okay hopefully so just unpack busy bag pencil case and flash baths I didn't look at as always here is the lovely exam paper let's just like not looking at put it somewhere away so my next exam is biochemistry and that's tomorrow afternoon so this is the longest kind of in the war between two exams I don't have any more morning which is so good because that's just a bit of a tight turnaround also the most frustrating thing is that the amount of information that you try and learn okay so there's so much information that I am trying to learn I have my flashcards war there's more stuff here like everything that you try and learn you learn so much and cram it in and the amount that you get to write and you get to go to the examiner that you know the amount that you actually write down on the paper is teeny weeny tiny but yeah I'm gonna phone mum about her nine how it was so I didn't get drenched in the rain today but it was spitting but it was kind of refreshing and then I went to the gym after I'm said my abs and stuff which I'm done in a while so I thought hello abdominal muscles I'm not gonna be making lunch and I'm trying to mix this almond butter because I'm making myself like toasted rye bread I am such a lover of toasted rye bread and when it's a bit burn like random bits of fruit some cucumber you know me I should have everything random in One Bowl if you're a bit confused and you haven't really seen that many of my videos then you might not actually know why study and what I do so I'm going to try and explain I do biology and I take this year a major subject and a minor subject the minor subject in which is what I was revising for this evening is biochemistry and I take one exam in my minor and then find major subject that is in pathology but I do two modules within pathology so one of them is immunology and the other one is cancer and genetic disease it gets even more complicated because the cancer and genetic disease module which I call CJD is split into two parts the first one is cancer II stuff and the second bit is genetics but there is obviously crossover and yeah so I then take for exams and we made for pathology and both have immunology and CTD and I am so tired Wow it has hit me hard I don't know my brain just feels like a massive fog it's not headache but it just feels full like to follow information and I'm just sensing here I'm trying to go through stuff and it's just like not going in I'm just feel as I'm so tired so I think I really just go to bed super early today get up tomorrow my exams in the afternoon and yeah because Wow oh okay three more days there you have to push through and I spoke to dad and he really just need to get sleep unless so dude I need to get sleep I cannot burn out you might have noticed there's this massive thing on the side of my lip it's not food that's not cold or cold slow pulse or I never know what that board anyway it's not one of those it's a cart that essentially won't heal yeah that's beautiful the consoling ah wake up wake up alright so I'm actually going to bed a bit earlier than usual I've been going to bed at about 11:00 every night it's currently like 15 minutes before 11:00 but that's better so I have these kind of like shape things that I use it's again at playing paper but I essentially write down the topic or the exam so this is my biochemistry one and then I write down the things I remember I look at it before I go to bed net hopes cuz it kind of goes into my mind if I look at it just before I go to bed I always have ones like this stuff or like one topic in particular and it's got a bit more information on it but yeah I just like to have these that I can just look up and I find I relate this for yeah  the best happy hump day anyone could ever ask for few topics I'm trying to go over like the majority of topics this morning this is like kind of quickly as I can that's why I kind of try and do before the morning for an exam if I have it in the afternoon the other day I tried to go through like two whole modules in the morning and it just didn't happen but I chemistry there's not that many well there are a few topics but I'm trying to go through quite she doesn't taste quite right yeah I just don't me I'm gonna rest eat in this and then like making myself feel well as much as I hate all throughout exam season and pretty much in general I will drink a smoothie for breakfast and then I usually have oats for lunch especially during exam season and high stress periods I like to have my set meals and my go to so it's a green smoothie and then as you can see at the moment I was mind mapping something so this is just a way to write down everything that I know and focus on the stuff that I maybe don't know so I just like to brainstorm in that way I find wine maps are really useful for essay plans and for trying to organize your notes or organize your thoughts on one topic that is what I was just doing for biochemistry I was trying to go through as much as possible as I said and obviously because my major module has cancer stuff in it there is quite a bit overlap which is really useful so does another exam I've already changed you love just this speaking to mom I was gonna speech you guys before Mike Sam I was a bit rushed and I was already late meeting is I was just like trying to revise like really quickly but didn't even come up in the end yeah the exam it was like hey one question was so broad it was basically like time we get a cancer hello to write an essay now about that I had so much I wanted to say and I got to write like it's much but yeah I try to get as much doubt is the last that ever I don't like scribbling to the end although the questions were like a lot more focused I was how the exam is that you do to that are focused I'm one of those very broad and I'm now done with my chemistry my minor it's done all I have now is two more times left I just think sense freedom oh my gosh and right now I'm already changed to go to the gym it's raining outside again which is super annoying but I'm gonna go to the gym I'm not I come back and guess what I really spoke to you guys this evening but I essentially went to the gym when I got back I've just been revising kind of sense so my exam tomorrow again three hours and the 90-minute assays do we have another 90 minute one for Amy ology and we always have the genetics part module so yeah these questions for the genetics one they tend to be a lot more obscure so a bit worried that they're gonna be really mean but I'm trying not to think negatively I'm just trying to think something like that I dunno stuff I'm telling myself I knew stuff I have mentioned before like the genetic stuff of my CGG module it's not my favorite but like I can't think pessimistically and yeah I'm just got a hope questions are okay so I can write something for 90 minutes which is quite a long time actually the other day both for 90 minutes exams the other day I'm still like I want more time yeah I'm gonna get in the shower now go got more vision I'm going bad I get worried restart day number for an exam number four there we go you know yeah I'm still wearing same jump on it's got to face today new edition I was a bit stressed before this exam bullying that is why I just didn't film anything other than waking up at 6:00 a.m. but yeah this exam okay so I had a slight panic attack when I read the questions I probably had this enough to the genetic stuff as I said and I read the first question and was like what even those I mean that didn't even make sense to me so I moved to the second one and there's a choice of three and I was like what I thought that was not gonna come up because I think similar came at large halls I'm not gonna realize that so I was like no so I moved to the third question I'm thank goodness I could do that one however I was writing the essay I did my plan and they kept doubting myself it's been like is this answering the question I'm sure it was but you don't even the exam sassing and you're just like doubting yourself but I did the essay when obviously I start the exam I also pick the essay that I'm gonna do for me Knology as well I read them really quickly and I was I can't go to through the first one and it was about like bacteria and stuff and vaccines and I was a bit like mm not really feeling that much but if I have to do I'll do it do when I finish the first steps annals I came uh smoother than hat all right the question semiology again second one I was definitely not gonna do because I had no clue how I could write about that for like it in 90 minutes based on what they told us I had no extra reading for as well I read the third one I was like actually my light bulb moment I was like I can do that question and I can actually use stuff that everyone for my designation for it so I was like let's do that so I swapped from doing bacteria to therapeutics and using the immune system which was actually quite good as it's right this toothpaste is very distracting another exam done is the reasonable thing yeah I was really stressed fighting for this one just because the genetic stuff was freaking me out I was so scared and then when I saw that question name I was like gonna cry oh right I'm gonna call mum the usual in my eyes is going about bloodshot I suddenly feel really hay fever II I just went on a run and I was fine until I got back and I was stretching out on the rooftop button and my eyes just started to get really itchy so yeah hey Theo just hold off one more day and then you can come at me full force after every exam whether that be in the morning or in the afternoon I would do some physical form of activity out either go on a run and that was third option if it wasn't raining so that I could get fresh air but otherwise I would then go to the gym it just means I can finish my exam and clear my mind a bit before I then start for the next again I was mind mapping and trying to write stuff down from memory and I did that I did some drills before I then made my dinner so I would every day make all of my food as well in college I didn't go to buttery I've never actually been to buttery in my three years shock horror guys but yeah I did myself loads of vegetative greens which is so important to me and then I was making myself one of my favorite meals which you can probably guess I want you guys to guess what do you think I was making other than the veg it has been a long time since I'm in the kitchen with you guys but anyway I have made myself my dinner it's very typical you probably know it is is this dripping in my food but yeah one of my favorite meals I basically have just been doing like really quick easy meals obviously during exam seasons but still eerily good food to me this is like the best meal of brown rice chickpeas and veg and then over like teeny which seem to land all in this position and that is my dinner memories gloves are dripping also I always add tumeric just over the top and you guys always told me I should mix it and cook it with the food which I am totally aware of I just forget a reasonable time but after he sounds like you focus and think of it more clearly about what I'm doing so just like going into autopilot we've done am eating food which is why I don't do I never thought I would make it this far but Friday the last day  Oh    [Applause]  [Applause]  oh my god I have finished honey won't believe it I am done like my degree I have done it everything i i i just she caught me this week and it hasn't even sunk in that i have finished these inc sounds like i so i would cry you really upset I'm just like well this guy's is how you'd finish your exams got some fizzy lemonade Paul you believe it the exams right to talk about the exam because it doesn't even matter now but it wasn't the best exam the questions what particularly good but we did it and we are now done and that was it I kind of drank my lemonade and celebrated by going to a formal which is basically just a semi fancy dinner in college shout out to Lucy it was her birthday and she has to take an exam on that day but yeah five exams guys in five days I never thought I would actually finish and get to the end it felt like I have been running a marathon or like climbing a huge mountain and I never thought I'd actually finish them and survived but we did it it feels really where that still doesn't feel right that I finished and I've technically done everything I can for this degree thank you as always for watching please like it if you enjoyed it and I will speak to you very soon guys bye you\",\n",

       " \"well former First Lady Michelle Obama thank you for being here to talk with us about your new book thanks for having me the book is called the light we carry overcoming in uncertain times and I have to tell you I read becoming and this is a really different book becoming was obviously this very intimate peeling back the layers of your personal story your family story that I think so many people have wanted to know for so long and but this book is it's more practical it's like a guidebook almost yeah I call it a tool kit I mean I think I'm like everybody over the last few years we have been struggling um you know economic uncertainty a pandemic isolation uh Injustice it's kind of left us all feeling out of sorts and so I get a lot of questions from people it's like how do I cope and given my motto when they go low we go high a lot of people these days have been struggling to figure out how to stay high when it feels like the world is in a low place and so this book is my best attempt at offering people at least an a look into my toolbox the practices and habits the people who keep me balanced and hopefully it'll start a conversation because I think that that's a lot of what we're feeling we've been locked away from one another and we're feeling disconnected and we need to get back together and uncover ourselves with each other and figure out how do we adapt in an inevitably uncertain world one of the things that you said in this book is that when you released becoming several years ago it was like a breath of fresh air after the time that your family spent in the white house so I'm curious to you as you're about to set off on your book tour as you're bringing this book into the world if that was a big breath if that was a release what does this process feel like ah you know whenever you are putting yourself out into the public I am no different it is frightening yeah you know I mean I I talk about in this book how even though becoming was a breath of fresh air There's Something about making yourself vulnerable in the world we may make it look easy but we still go through that doubting process did I share too much um how will people receive the truth that I have to offer um so you know I'm in that same place with uh with this book My Hope Is that people will find something useful in it and I have been I've spent my time alone with this book uh talking with myself and with the few people that I've let look at it now I'm sharing these thoughts do they make sense do they connect with people do they resonate I don't know so that there is still a fear a doubt a vulnerability that goes into any project that I take on um so I'm feeling a little nervous you know what strikes me when I'm reading the book is you get vulnerable not just about yourself but you talk about your marriage we learn about the fact that your daughters are now dating were you you talk about this idea of being comfortably afraid of really being able to harness that fear were you how did you think about the things that you shared with all of us with your readers about your family's lives you know I I always have to strike a balance of how much uh sharing will help people and how do I make sure that I'm protecting my family's privacy um but I think about my writing like I think about everything else I learn from stories um I I never want to produce anything that feels a didactic finger-pointing all I have is my own authentic truth um so I I feel like if I'm coming from that place and I've gotten the permission of my family members then I feel like a okay there's a lesson here so when I talk about my relationship with my husband it's because I know that there are a lot of young people who are trying to figure out how do you what is a marriage how do you shape a relationship I am fascinated by how little we talk to young people young adults about what it actually means to partner with somebody and what those compromises look like and you know pushing them to answer questions for themselves of what are you trying to get out of this relationship with this other person have you thought it through are you seeking a wedding or do you want a relationship those are two very different things so in the chapter that's called partnering well again I share my journey with my husband the things that stuck out for me what I was trying to find in another person and how that worked out over the the course of 30 years we have we are now celebrating our 30th anniversary with the hopes that you know it will create a conversation among the next generation of people trying to start to build their lives what do you look for in a partner what do you have to bring to a relationship yourself in order to make it whole and healthy I got something that so many people are curious about people I think and you've written about this they've idealized your marriage they sit there and look at it but you have always been very clear out and very honest that marriage makes work it takes daily work and that it is not always glamorous and you have had some very unique strains but there's also the strains that any of us who are in a relationship or married face whether it be whose career goes first or who takes on the child care labor how do you think about is there one piece of advice that you would give for people who are thinking about how you put in that work for a partnership that's lasted that yeah it's not really one piece of advice it's to me it's a philosophy it's an Outlook um you know in in this age of we want everything now we want everything quick we you know when life is everything but that um marriage is we have to understand that marriage is never 50 50. um and you know you sort of wonder how that idea kind of got out there um I have found that if you stick with it you know over the course of your entire relationship you may have 50 50 over time but if I look over my marriage if I were to judge it in year five or year 10 there was never 50 50. somebody was always giving way more someone always needed a different kind of thing you have to evolve with it and so yeah yeah there were times when I felt like I was 70 percent in and he was doing 30 percent um but I think that and and I've had to compromise uh as he has I've had to because of the choices that I made in the terms of how I wanted our family to look I had to take my foot off of my career gas pedal uh never putting on the break but slowing up a little bit um those are the natural compromises that are required and I feel bad when I see young people giving up on their relationships because there's there are periods of hard there are periods of discomfort um as I have told young people who ask me about marriage I was like you have to be prepared to have long stretches of discomfort and long I mean it could last for years and don't put kids into the equation because that's just another layer of complication you love them to death but they will shake take your marriage up and turn you both upside down so I think it's important for us to be honest in those conversations not to glamorize what a partnership feels like because then young people quit too soon they quit before they've really you know played out the full scenario so one of the things that I loved that was a through line that ran throughout this book is the the revolving relationships between parents and children and particularly mothers and daughters and you wrote a lot about your relationship with your mom who we all know played a pivotal role with living with your family during your years in the white house I'm curious what has that been like for me as your relationship has evolved into being both adults now having adult children what does that look like for me I think it's a beautiful Journey you know um one of the things I share some of the you know sort of uh unique brand of wisdom that my my parents brought to their parenting I share that in the book but something I admired about my mother is that you know she had a clear philosophy about parenting which is unusual for somebody of her generation there weren't all the what to expect books and the Doctor Who do you do books on how to parent but there were just some a common sense way that approach that she brought to Parenting but she always talked about she said I'm I'm not raising children I'm raising adults um and so I always had an interestingly open and honest conversation with my parents they encouraged us to talk at an early age to find our voices she made sure we felt heard she made sure that she took our concerns and issues seriously we were never treated as kids should be seen and not heard so when you have that Foundation you know your relationship is always I feel at least with my mother and I've tried to do that with my daughters has been on a steady course of growth but you still have to be ready for your your kids to evolve you know who they are at four and seven is not what and what they need from you is very different from what they need from you as teenagers and then again as young women but if you've laid a foundation of trust and honesty every stage I found is is wonderful it's full it's exciting I don't miss any stage I I loved every stage of parenting my girls but I wouldn't go back to any no of the stages I don't long for the time when they were babies I love that time breastfeeding when you you know you could sit and hold them and look at them forever but now that they're young women you know and now I'm less of a day-to-day manager and more of an advisor there's a there's a freedom to enjoy them as individuals to watch them grow and I think that's been the case for me and my mom as well with your girls though has that been comfortable for you the idea of stepping back from that manager role and letting them lead letting them be the people who make you and your husband as you say weak martinis when you come and visit their apartment that I couldn't stop laughing when I read that you know well that's that it is a hard thing to do to let your kids be um you know in this era of helicopter parenting you know where I think parents are very maybe overly involved in their kids lives um I was raised to be handed my competence early you know my mother raised her as I write in the book she says her job is to put herself out of a job early so she started at a very early age requiring us to be independent you know as early as kindergarten she gave us alarm clocks because she knew that we were capable of getting ourselves up she wanted us to feel the power of our competence so from five years old I was setting an alarm soon thereafter I was walking to school by myself and what that does for a kid when your parent trusts you you know it it it encourages you it tells you that if my mom thinks I can do this then I must be capable and I've tried to instill that same kind of Stand by the gate and watch your kids fly be there for them when they come back let them know that you will be their Advocate but don't step in and try to live their lives for them and so when I see my kids flourishing in that way when I see them owning all their choices and succeeding and failing on their own terms and growing from that process it is one of the most satisfying experiences it is frightening it is frightening to watch your children walk into a brick wall but that's what growth is and you know and too many parents try to stop that process but that's the quickest way for them to learn to learn from owning their mistakes and owning their victories at the same time but you got to get adjusted I mean I talk about how you know when you're letting your kids go you're letting your heart out there in the world that Barack and I kind of do this kind of crazy parent text check-in you know like writing things that are keeping us up at night Barack one one day sent them a text on earthquake preparedness because they now live in LA and it's that's the kind of thing you do as a parent you think uh oh there are earthquakes have I warned them are they prepared so in the middle of the night he's sending some article on a 10-step plan that includes you know getting earthquake training and stocking up on water and the response from one of my daughters was okay which of these things do you think we should do because it's a lot right but that's our own anxiety playing itself out um you know what did I miss you know what more can I feed into you to make sure that you're safe and sound and secure but the truth of the matter is that we we don't control that and as a parent that's a hard thing to come to grips with as your child is you is your child grows up and is out there in that big bad world is that you can prepare and love them all all that you can and you still don't have control there are no guarantees that their life is going to work out and something bad may happen that is the hardest thing about parenting is living with that truth but the alternative is to stop them from growing and that in my view would be the sad outcome if my kids were sitting safe in my basement or in their rooms at home uh with me feeling comforted in the fact that I knew what they were doing and where they were but not owning their own lives I think that would be the sadder outcome so I have to remind myself of that you know when I get the urge to step in uh but that's why I tell people parenting is hard it isn't just hard because it's hard it's hard because it's emotionally you are in your most vulnerable space um now I could go on and on but I do write about a lot of that in the book one of the other things you touch on in the book is you are very open and candid about acknowledging the fact that you have support and you have help and you have had help throughout your life in raising your children and you point find out that any High earning successful women who report to have it all and do it all they've got help so I want to ask you what disservice do we do to people particularly women and caregivers when we don't all acknowledge and aren't as transparent about the fact that we have help especially given that we are coming out of a two to three year period that is exposed so much strain in our caregiving infrastructure in this country well that's the you know the the Trope that we wear as women that we're supposed to be able to do it all um you know and I don't know where that came from you know when I look back on the women in my life you know it was a real necessity you know the the matriarchs of our household did do it all as black women with men whose opportunities were limited because of Jim Crow and segregation you know where a black man was more of a threat so a black woman could you know have a more consistency in their earning potential but still had to hold down the traditional wife and mother role of cooking and child rearing you know if I look back over my personal history I can see where you know that's what was modeled to us that the mothers in our lives did everything you know they mother they worked they took care of the home so we're emulating that particularly as women of color you know that's that's a sign of strength you know so we don't ask for help we are not conditioned to think that that that's not a weakness um so yes I think it's a disservice when those of us who are out here modeling it aren't being real clear about the fact that we are not meant to do this life alone we are not meant I believe we were not meant to parent alone you know the whole concept of a nuclear family you know just me my husband if you're lucky and the kid kids and this is our unit and we live independently that's a fairly new phenomenon to our generation you know for uh decades people have lived in extended family units you know I wrote about that into coming I grew up in a community surrounded by family members I had maternal grandparents around the corner paternal grandparents uh you know down the street we lived above the home of a great aunt we saw each other regularly our families cousins together almost every weekend celebrating birthday parties and and I can't think of a time where I had to have a babysitter because there was just always somebody that was chipping in somebody would pop over you'd go over somebody else's house so now here we sit in our generation many of us have moved away from our family units our communities of support and we're off in some city with a big job still trying to emulate what our our grandparents and grandmothers and fathers did that doesn't work you know you need if you're working outside of the home because we all are working inside of the home you know there is no um shame in in getting support your your kids will value it they will value you being less stressful now the guilty part of that piece if you're a woman who has the resources is that we all know women who don't have that choice so sometimes we hide it because it's like dag how am I talking about a nanny and this and that when I know that there are women my peers my my cousins my who don't have that support they're doing just as much as I'm doing but they can't afford they don't have access to affordable child care they couldn't think of having a nanny you know they don't have flexibility in their work schedule so part of it is that there's a kind of survivor's remorse about what you're able to do but I think we still have to talk about the fact that family units have to be based on a big community of support there is um there is uh nothing particularly Courageous about doing life alone you know um but you know if we if if those of us who are doing it aren't being honest about how hard that is and what it takes to actually get it right then we're mirroring the wrong things for the generation to come and I don't want to do that to my girls you know yeah one of the things that you walk through in the book and you talk about a number of the ways in which your life and the journey that your family has been on has been incredibly exceptional but you also talk about some incredibly relatable experiences such as the isolation of being the only whether it is the only woman of color the only black person in the room of being the only person who didn't come for money at a college and I wonder now all these years later in the journey that you have been on do you still feel that way sometimes and how do you deal with it yeah honestly of course as Michelle Obama you know I feel it less acutely um but that's fairly recent you know I mean when we were in the white house we were the the first and the only at many tables of power um watching people adjust to that um that was very reminiscent of the experiences that I had you know going to college and practicing in a corporate law firm and sitting around board uh seats and on and on and on um but what I found is over time and I write about this is that you know we can't change that reality um we are still sadly breaking barriers right I mean it is unfortunate that uh the percentages of students of color on college campuses is remaining relatively sadly stagnant the same is true and if you look at corporate law the numbers of Associates and partners in large firms has not really significantly increased um so we still are struggling to make progress so in the meantime we're dealing with the reality of the fact that yeah we're still trying to fill those seats so how do we get through in the meantime um because when you're an only there's uh as I describe it there's a a feeling of walking around trying to navigate a a town or a city with a road map that doesn't fit you know you're playing a game with someone else's rules um you feel isolated and disconnected sometimes outside of your own body and what happens when that occurs is that you start feeling self-conscious you spend more time thinking about your loneliness you're carrying that burden rather than focusing on the task at hand and that is that makes overcoming all that just even more difficult um what I had to learn to do was to first get out of my own head not easy though it's not it is not an easy thing to do and it takes practice but part of what this book is reminding us is that there are no Miracle answers to these things overcoming imposter syndrome feeling like you belong right um there isn't a this is these are the three steps you take to feeling seen right doesn't happen that way for me I have practiced trying to get out of my head for 58 years now it is a daily reminder that I have to uh take the mask that I am trying to hold up on my face take it down so that I can see what I'm doing and by mask I mean stop trying to stop pretending to be something that I'm not trying to fit in and leave behind the parts of me that make me real and authentic stop worrying about how I wear my hair and what somebody is going to think about it you know stop thinking about how I conjugate my verbs or what stories I tell about myself to make me fit into somebody else's world that gets in we get in our way with that but it takes practice and I open the book by urging young people to read it to understand that patience is an important tool in in developing your own set of tools what I am able to do now the messages that I tell myself now at 58 are very different than what I needed to say to myself at 20. but I know now have a lifetime of understanding that I have been practicing through being the only of quieting my doubtful mind and then speaking up and using my experiences as the source code as I say to the power that I actually have and bring you know it doesn't happen overnight but we have to keep telling ourselves I am going to show up in the world as my authentic self and that is good enough that's the work that we have to do I wish there were shortcuts um but it is what it is you mentioned patience and that is something that I've been wanting to ask you about you mentioned earlier the call to action that many of us know you for when they go low we go high and in a past life before I had this job I was a political correspondent and I spent a lot of time traveling this country and talking to young people in particular and what I heard a lot and I'm sure you hear this too from the people who write you letters or come to events that you hold is the fact that they want to believe in a world of going high but they feel a sense of urgency oftentimes they express that they feel a sense of Rage given all of the hurt and harm and marginalization the Insurrection attacks on lgbtq rights anti-Semitism I could the list the laundry list could go on how does going high square with the urgency that so many people feel especially young people feel In This Moment well that's the interesting thing because young people interpret some young people interpret going high as being complacent you know going going high doesn't mean sitting on the side of the road and watching you know Injustice go by going high is about having a strategy a real concrete strategy for change it's taking the rage and turning it into reason so that you can actually be heard and move toward change so when I think about going high I'm usually thinking at a time when I'm feeling the rage and I feel the need to react I I've learned to ask myself am I indulging my rage is what I'm about to do or say gonna make me feel good in the short term but have no impact over the long term right because the goal is the impact ultimately you know um that's what Barack and I had to do every day in the White House you know I used to play this game with my communication staff before an interview or something where we would sort of walk through the questions and there'd be some question that would be what I call a knucklehead question you know and I'd I'd practice my true response right my I shouldn't say true my gut response because sometimes just playing it out loud helps to get it out but then when you put your your first gut reaction out there for the world to see in here and then you look at it for a minute and you go ah well that's not even how I really feel you know um and what's going to be the outcome you know there's going to be half the country that won't even hear the rest of the the solution if I start there if I start with my rage and anger all I will do is play out my rage and anger but I won't be able to affect any change going high is about the ultimate goal of where are we trying to go and what's the best way to get there and over the course of history especially the history of civil rights there was the rage but there was always the plan you know the March on Washington was the cherry on top after Decades of legislative action and strategic sit-downs you know the March wasn't the it wasn't the beginning or the end and that's what we have to figure out what is the true beginning and where are we trying to get to there is room for rage in that you know there's there's and there's urgency in that the other thing I try to remind young people is that um it's easy to look at what your press predecessors have done and to say not enough why not why not faster why not better why not bigger and what I say is young people aren't wrong to feel that that's that's why folks need to get out of the way and pass on you know pass on the power to the Next Generation but what we can't lose sight of is that every generation in this movement toward whatever change they are they are laying the marker that they can at the time they are working within the confines with the doubts in their heads the the history that they come from we do ourselves no good by being mad because the folks aren't our team didn't do more people are doing what they can do with what they have and I can guarantee you that this generation of young people that are complaining about the lack of urgency will get to our age and their kids will look at them and say why'd you do more faster the nature of change it it is a slog it is a marathon and it will never feel like enough because until everything is perfect it will always be urgent but in the meantime what I urge young people to do is be be be rageful you you and own it but have a plan have a strategy that can work um know what it is be thoughtful about that approach and make sure that what you say is really what you mean and how you feel over the long term and not just today you know it strikes me as you write about how imperative it is that we should still go high that we have we're coming out of this period where all of us have faced so many challenges um tomorrow former president Trump is expected to announce that he's going to run for president yet again um and I just wonder you talk about this toolbox what goes through your head and what tools do you reach for when you think about something like that oh i i i and my husband helps me with this I I think about the context of the history of our country of our world and I realize that you know this is a moment this is a moment and we cannot let a moment turn us so upside down that we can't function you know um the the the Arc of change doesn't just go straight up it goes up and down and up and down and so in these moments I tell myself I ask myself and this is a chapter that I I call the power of small all right what can I do in this moment that I can uniquely control when I think something's about to happen that I cannot control right um voting is one of those things you know it doesn't feel like a lot you know it's a small action that happens on a Tuesday uh every couple of years would happen more if people voted more and focused on their local elections too um but that's one of those things you know if you if you don't like the guy that's running the power that we have in our democracy however small it is is that we each have the responsibility and the right to vote at least right now so let us exercise it you know so that we're we're not in a position to take it for granted and have those rights snatched away because let me tell you if we don't if we don't use them if we don't protect them fiercely even when the person who won isn't somebody that we agree with we will lose those rights we've seen it with uh abortion rights we've seen it we've experienced it I can't tell you how many times we got on the campaign Trail over the last eight years and said this election is important you know because the Supreme Court is at risk you know it matters who's on the Supreme Court Roe v Wade is you know is in jeopardy and watching election after election people not turning out you know um because they didn't like that guy they were mad about the fact why is he even running you know and it's not necessarily Trump but anybody right the governor's race the U.S attorney you know we sit out we don't we don't do the work because we're mad about who's in um we have this small power each of us to shape the direction of the country and if we don't use it you know I I mean I I you know I I never want to throw my hands up but I think what what are we going to do in this democracy if we quit on it for my First Lady Michelle Obama thank you so much for spending some time with us today thank you it's been a real pleasure thanks so much\",\n",
       " \"Karl Marx is often described as one of the greatest thinkers of the 19th century his writings have inspired revolutions and generated centuries of fierce debate born in Prussia now Germany in May 1818 Marx believed that capitalism which was in its infancy at the time had serious flaws Marx claimed that in pursuit of profit capitalists would encourage their ideology that work is good leisure is bad and material things will make us happy embracing mass production depriving workers of job satisfaction at the same time exploiting the working-class he became involved in the communist League a small group of intellectuals who wanted to abolish the class system and spread wealth equally Marx wrote the communist manifesto in 1847 with his benefactor Friedrich Engels laying out the Marxist vision of a society where wealth was distributed evenly property is owned publicly and education is free for all but Marx was little known and little read at the time when he died in 1883 only eleven people attended his funeral after his death his ideas flourished based on the theory of Marxism came communism the realization of a stateless society where all are equal communism became a global movement but the utopian ideal of a fair and equal society failed to materialize communism terrorized and impoverished its subjects and slaughtered them in the tens of millions today capitalism dominates the world but many of Marx's criticisms have never been more relevant today the global disparity between rich and poor is striking Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to the rich getting richer and the poor staying Paul he was right he also predicted that capitalism would lead to boom and bust economics Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to globalization and that a handful of firms would have huge market dominance  however Marx underestimated the ability of capitalism to make everybody richer by making products much cheaper since the 1980s the number of people in absolute poverty has fallen by about 1 billion he also got wrong the capacity of capitalism to reform itself by creating welfare states that redistributed wealth through taxation although there is a lot to learn from Marx his solution was far worse than the disease at the same time it can't be said that today's capitalism dominated by immense inequality and financial crises has triumphed  you\",\n",
       " \"2023 a year that many are facing with trepidation and whilst much of the world will be tightening its belt there are plenty of ways in which 2023 is set to challenge assumptions from antique treasures and old-fashioned solutions to psychedelic Revelations and the fate of the world's biggest population here are five stories that may just transform the world ahead  in 2023 the most populous country on the planet will no longer be China but India China's population is peaking while India's has continued to grow and the UN predicts that on April the 14th 2023 India's population will overtake that of China's that is hugely significant in symbolic terms but what's more important is the composition of the Indian population specifically the size of its working age population India has more people of working age than any other population group when this happens it can lead to what's known as a demographic dividend because of the opportunity it offers for economic growth particularly for developing countries take what happened in China a population boom under Mao was followed by the introduction of the one child policy in 1979. this created a big working age population with fewer children to raise providing the Manpower for China's extraordinary economic expansion India's demographic bulge started much later than China's in the 2010s its forecast to continue to around 2050. with the biggest growth in the next decade  is on this opportunity a bigger working age population in theory should mean greater productivity but in India there are obstacles to its success for a start about 90 percent of jobs in India are informal which means the vast majority of workers don't have a regular salary informal sector workers are quite productive the problem is that these are very insecure jobs and so we knew things like kovid happened suddenly many of these workers are out of work so Indian government has been trying to set up some national pension schemes health insurance benefits and so on but Social Security benefits are quite limited for many of these workers what's more just 20 percent of women of working age are actually working part of the problem is that while girls are being educated to a higher level it's often not high enough to work in offices so what for these women in the regime it's quite difficult to find one for men of the same education there are many jobs like truck drivers mobile phone repairers poster delivery workers a lot of these occupations are not really open to women part of China's rapid economic growth was due to the foreign company's factories that were set up there the Indian government has been trying to mimic this with a make in India campaign to entice foreign investment it's had some success in a big boost to India's manufacturing sector Apple says that it plans to make the iPhone 14 in India but the country's infrastructure and the state of its Workforce remain a barrier the proportion of the labor force that has any formal training is extremely small around three percent there's very high level still of malnutrition anemia and other health issues that means that a lot of people coming into the labor force cognitive and physical development may have been impaired the challenge for the Indian government is to create the economic environment to encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to create jobs so that it can reap the rewards of being the most populous country on the planet 2023 could be the year that party drugs get closer to being in your prescriptions with three different psychedelic drugs in Phase 3 trials to treat mental health conditions MDMA could even be approved to treat post-traumatic stress disorder in America 2023 could potentially be a landmark year for us this could be the first psychedelic assisted therapy approved by a regulatory body in any given year around 12 million Americans suffer from PTSD and for some like veteran John lubecky it can last many years he was a participant in a phase II trial run by Maps PBC which has been developing MDMA assisted therapy since 2004. you're experience me it's kind of weird various periods of my life the treatment combines three doses of MDMA followed by Psychotherapy sessions it's not just the MDMA it's not just the therapy it's the two of them working together the results of our first pivotal phase three study thought at 67 percent of the people in the MDMA group no longer met the criteria for having PTSD fmdma does get approved for PTSD in 2023 it will be again for patients who really have limited options at the moment for treating this very difficult and this terrible condition psychedelics like MDMA can make therapy much more effective they can dampen activity in the part of the brain that processes fear and release feel-good hormones and neurotransmitters like serotonin which help reduce anxiety and increase empathy making it easier for a patient to reflect on a traumatic experience psilocybin also known as magic mushrooms will also be in a phase 3 trial of a global study for treatment resistant depression that also has had a successful trial so far after having this therapy 12 weeks later about one in five are in remission a third drug normally associated with nightclubs is also in this critical final stage of testing ketamine-assisted therapy is showing promise in helping with alcohol use disorder in the most recent study 86 percent of patients were still abstained from alcohol six months after treatment already offered at awakens private clinics ketamine could eventually be regulated for General use in Britain we're seeing them being hyped as curals for lots and lots of different mental health conditions and while I'm really excited about their promise I do think it's really important that patients have realistic expectations about what they can achieve but all in all I think what we're looking at is 2023 is going to be a really pivotal year for psychedelic medicines hello I'm Tom standage editor of the world ahead to read about the prospects for the coming year in more detail and get a head start on more of the themes and Trends to watch take out a subscription to The Economist which includes full access to the world ahead 2023 to get the best offer click on the link and now on with the fill in 2023 there's one country which could make a global recession much worse Japan Japan's the third largest economy and it's an important economy because its financial sector is intertwined with the financial sector of the rest of the world Japan is the world's biggest creditor country it holds trillions of dollars of assets overseas which means what happens here has the potential to affect the world's financial markets in recent years Japan's Central Bank the bank of Japan has been reassuring a predictable keeping interest rates low thanks to its very low inflation interest rates only have to go up when inflation Rises and that just hasn't happened so for a long time Japan defied any predictions that it would have to raise interest rates or Titan monetary policy to the extent that betting that it would have to do that was a notorious way to lose money it was a trade called the Widowmaker it was always wrong even in the face of the pandemic and the energy crisis the bank of Japan held fast thank you the bank of Japan increasingly an outlier keeping its overnight interest rate at minus 0.1 percent the dovish tone continues oh boy does it ever that is until now as interest rates have risen elsewhere in the world Japan has found itself exposed by the widening Gap the effect of that has been to make the Japanese currency the Yen less attractive to International investors because if you buy the Yen and invest in the Japanese bond market you're getting a lower interest rate lower return than if you invest in the U.S treasury market say where you can benefit from those higher interest rates as a result the Yen has fallen against the dollar making Imports more expensive for Japan which pushed up the rate of inflation so at the end of 2022 the bank of Japan did something unexpected it was all to do with the interest rate known as the yield on one particular form of Japanese government debt its 10-year bond the yield on this bond is crucial in Japan because it affects a lot of economic activity often borrowing by companies mortgages and all kinds of contracts are related to long-term interest rates so the idea is by keeping those interest rates low you stimulate spending and growth in the economy the Japanese Central Bank has certainly done that by capping the yield of its 10-year bonds at 0.25 percent the yield of a long-term Bond moves in the opposite direction to its price so in order to keep the cap in place the bank of Japan has been buying as many bonds as necessary but in December 2022 the bank of Japan increased the cap to 0.5 percent it might seem a relatively small move but it was enough to destabilize the markets Global markets were jolted overnight after the bank of Japan unexpectedly widened its cap on 10-year Japanese government bond yields and it was also an indication that in 2023 the bank of Japan might go even further the question is how much further it could ditch the cap completely but it could also start to increase short-term interest rates too as other central banks have done already what's happened in 2022 is that central banks around the world and most importantly America's federal reserve have been raising interest rates and what that's meant is that there's been a growing gap between interest rates in Japan and in the rest of the world the Federal Reserve for example has increased interest rates from 0.25 percent at the start of 2022 to 4.5 percent at the end but if interest rates in Japan climb the same distance in 2023 it would be much more concerning because Japan has the highest level of public debt of any rich country while interest rates were low high public debt was manageable but if interest rates rise investors will start to worry that Japan might not be able to service its debt and start to sell their bonds causing bond yields to go up Suddenly It's going to be more expensive for companies and for individuals to borrow if there's a dramatic repricing in rates that can be quite destabilizing for the economy and because Japan is so intertwined with the rest of the world this destabilization could spread to other financial markets which means what the bank of Japan chooses to do in 2023 could make any Global recession much worse  foreign  it'll be back to the future for the fashion industry as make do and mend we'll be back on trend big clothing brands won't just be selling new clothes but perhaps surprisingly also encouraging more wear out of old items too Tommy Hilfiger Hugo Boss and lvmh the world's biggest luxury group are all set to launch their own repair and resale services in 2023 it will all be part of a wider push towards a more eco-friendly fashion industry today we are making more clothes than ever before but we're using them less pretty much the entire fashion industry operates under the same model increasing throughput and number of Seasons very very limited clothing is actually designed to be remade repaired reused or recycled every second the equivalent of a rubbish truck of textiles is burnt or buried in landfill one way to eliminate waste and pollution is through what is known as a circular economy essentially keeping products in use for longer  save your wardrobe is a new digital business that has spotted an opportunity to do just that it buttons up so tight that we're going to make it a cropped jacket so it's going to just above the pockets growing up in Tunisia I was really passionate about seeing how local tailors were able super fast to create new things or repair things and coming to Europe I realized that it was all replaced by fast behaviors of purchasing I thought let's explore this opportunity using the app customers can transform their worn out wardrobes everything about severe wardrobe started because I loved seeing things remade again and again our recent research shows that things like circular business models like resale rental repair and remaking have the possibility to be 23 of the global fashion industry by 2030 which represents a market opportunity of 700 billion US dollars  but there is a risk to all this Brands could use repair services as green washing without actually helping the planet if an organization is offering a service like repair but to use that service they'll give you a voucher off their traditional linear sales this is incentivizing growth of their linear business model rather than actually mainstream transition to a circular economy for that business any claims that organizations are making should be really specific and should have very clear definitions attached thank you on May the 6th 2023 Charles III will be crowned King of the United Kingdom while all eyes will be on him some may glance at his wife Camilla and especially what she chooses to wear on her head it's said that he wants queen Camilla to wear the crown that his grandmother wore at her coronation in 1937. at the center of that Crown sits the Kohinoor diamond which was taken from India in 1849 was presented to Queen Victoria but the idea that this was any real way a gift very much in dispute if she wears it one expert has said that for Indians this would be a massive diplomatic grenade in 2023 the Crown's Colonial passed will add fuel to broader debate over the repatriation of artifacts taken from other countries the movement in favor of restitution is becoming increasingly strong people should be allowed to see the art of their own countries in their own countries Glasgow life museums will be the first in Britain to return artifacts to India all seven objects will be going back to New Delhi and they have a museum which is devoted to the display of confiscated or returned artifacts our aspiration is to develop strong contemporary Partnerships across the world we don't think that's possible if we continue to retain objects to which we don't have legal or or moral title and so part of the process is to address some of these these These past mistakes and to to rectify them the Indian artifacts aren't the only items being sent home Glasgow is also returning Benin bronzes part of a wider campaign to repatriate these artifacts to what is now Nigeria the national commission for Museum and monuments of Nigeria are acting on behalf of the Uber of Benin they're trying to build a facility to house all of the returning bronzers thousands of bronzers were looted from Benin City when British troops invaded in 1897. is an artist who is part of the campaign to repatriate them to Nigeria collectively the Formby Encyclopedia of our history of our culture so in taking them away and locking them involved in various museums all over the world except in Africa it creates a void we can't access as a people the truths which our ancestors have encoded other collections in Britain and around the world have also approved returning bronzes but restitution remains a controversial subject the objects may be seen is just simply walk some art and therefore why is there a need to return them but their spiritual and cultural significance is uh often way more important and if one recognizes that then the return of the object becomes an obvious step to take there are numerous items in museums across the world that are wanted back by their country of origin among the most infamous are the Parthenon marbles many of which have been on display in the British museum for two centuries a Greek newspaper has revealed the museum has been in talks about their possible return but there are many legal barriers to restitution often making it a political decision rather than one solely for the museum trustees which means it remains to be seen whether the Parthenon marbles the Indian Kohinoor diamond or indeed any other artifacts might make their way home 2023 is going to be a huge year for this expect movement on requests from Egypt from Ethiopia from Ghana from the Pacific Islands from Easter Island from Latin America for things to be returned this is not going to stop

       "[\"So I don't want to cry in this video because I cried the other day if I can't guarantee that I won't cry generally thank you very much for coming to Cambridge for an interview for the graduate course in Medicine this year before Color Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla after detailed consideration. I'm very sorry to say that we are not able to make you an offer yeah I applied and I didn't get in that email came in to me and the other day what day he came in on Thursday. I feel fine I'm not trying these things online. Why Holi we haven't even got a few minutes into the video and we're crying Oh my gosh right stop, Oh right breathe. I had stuff to say in this video. I can't be crying no Oh for those of you that have been following my application. I'm Madison so over the summer. I did work experience and then I was about sure as to whether I was going to apply, but in the end I decided that I was just gonna make quite a last-minute application and just see how it goes. I didn't want to overburden myself or loads into you. So I was like I'll just apply for one University this year and give it my best shot and see what the outcome is and yeah and the outcome is I haven't been successful. I haven't got a place you can see why not a t-shirt under this that's fine in my head. It's not fine but it will be fine. I'm telling myself it's gonna be fine. I'll eventually come to terms with it but right now it's still a bit like touchy-feely clearly fully stopped it came in as an email. I. come in as an email because everything was happening by email It just pinged in and I saw. I recognized the person that sends it you've all smells like Oh my gosh. There is I was just in the middle of walking. I think on Thursday today and I read it and yeah. It was like a very quick decision. It's been made and not even two weeks. I'm kind of bad in a way I didn't really want it to drag on Yeah I got upset. I sent a message to Mum and everyone at home and I spoke to them. I was in tears yes like I am now. It was worse the other day Yeah I mean facing rejection is hard. It's really hot on Thursday. I had the fits winter ball with the dance people. We were dancing really late till midnight and then the following. Day so Friday yesterday I had dance as well um I haven't told anyone yet in Cambridge anyway. I've told is he just because she's probably one of the closest people. I know her and yes. I I'm gonna tell people but I didn't want to mention it on Thursday or yesterday just because I knew that it would throw me off and I didn't want it to affect the way I was dancing if I'd have told people I would have gotten upset. I would have ruined my makeup day, but B I just wanted to like you dance and not really let it get to me and I didn't want to put a downer on us doing fits poor. So I didn't tell anyone I just hope you brought home and then I told Izzy the other day I'm more people yes we'll just find out from me. putting it on line 24 anything online anyone can see it that's fine. I'm not bothered about that but yeah that's why I didn't tell anyone in person straight away and then about the actual email. I got because they did give us a bit more information. He just stopped sniffing anyway. They said the week had got feedback but only in the new year. So obviously I will find out where I maybe went wrong or maybe something that I didn't do right or something I needed more of. But they said that they had 550 applicants and they offered 41 places. I think they said to us on the day of the interview that about 90 to 100 we're given it to you so it's a very big car and it's very competitive. The application process you get scored all the way through it's very quantitative which I. Suppose makes a less objective that's dope they take into account your application so your personal statement which I wrote my new cast my references and I suppose my predicted grades and my grades from Fasten second here and a little stuff like that and then 60% of it so the majority of it is based on my interview performance. So we had to do Alum eyes, which is what I had the other week. Yeah the interviews just scored on a lot of different things. They say that each station has scored out of a certain number and then they just add them up by space and they have their 41 places offered. They also said that Watkins had a star a a at least available, and they said that because of the competition being really high. They gave more credit to people that had already graduated with a first-class degree, as opposed to those that were predicted at first. So they did encourage people to reapply. So I suppose that as applicable to me because I don't yet have a degree by suppose there may have been other factors like I may have not performed very well and some of the interview stations. I don't know because they said that the strongest applicants basically would very good at interview. They didn't have very bad scores yeah. I might not have done very well and-I mean I didn't have very long to prepare for it. I tried to pound a week by me. I did my best I did what. what I could and it just wasn't good enough this year and so I wanted to talk to you guys to not only tell you but I wanted to sit down and tell myself as well as you guys why it's okay. I've been rejected and why being rejected it's something that you in there from so as I said at the moment. I'm very much like disheartened and I think one of the main reasons is the fact that I kind of tried to put a lot into it. When I knew I had it in to I was like okay. I'm gonna really give it my shot and I've been working on this like over summer. I've been doing a lot of stuff for it. I did my personal statement and I just feel like a lot of that work preparing and doing stuff for it it's just time wasted. Obviously it's not wasted, but at the moment I just felt as if I have wasted a lot of time, but it's a learning curve and I really need to use it as a learning curve and I need to accept the fact that's okay. I've been rejected. You know like I shouldn't be sitting here crying. I'm annoyed at myself for crying and then same time. I'm not upset because I'm just very lost now with life. I'm very confused yeah I just I don't know what I'm gonna do now so any more decisions I need to make and I ain't making decisions and I have to just go through the whole process again thinking about my options and all the things I. can do and what I really want to do and right now. I'm just so confused Then I just don't know what I'm gonna do you Don't realize how draining these application prices are until you finish and you hear the result when you're like either Wow yes it was worth it or oh great nothing's come from a sort of thing and for me it's don't think that nothing's come from it so now I'm back to square one. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life. I'm thinking very pessimistically here right now, but when things happens like this you can do anything negatively and it's really hard to see you know the silver lining because every cloud we have to make mistakes we have to do things wrong. We have to be rejected to be a better person and I'm kind of glad that something. has gone wrong? It's gonna make me a better person. I know so I'm kind of glad in a way and I was kind of waiting for something like this to happen. I was like I need to be rejected or I need to have something bad happened. So I'm kind of God yes I took the risk and I just applied to one Uni. I could have applied to lots more and maybe got a place but I just didn't want to have loads of interviews so I just applied to one so I mean I can't I can only really blame myself and that's fine in terms of what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna have to rethink. I kind of want to know what I want to do and I kind of want to have things sorted. I mean I say that I would love to have. a spontaneous life you know and just go ahead go that but when it comes to it. I'm probably not one of those people and I like to have things planned and organized as you guys know with my to-do lists. I don't really want to go straight into a job like they can apply next year for Graduate Medical again but it's just the fact that I'm gonna have now and actually yeah and that might be the best year of my life. You know like I could trouble. I could maybe do a [UNK] in the meantime which will be three years or I could do a master's or I can maybe a part-time job. I don't know or I could maybe go into dance. There are so many things. I can maybe try and do but right now. I'm I just don't know which one of them. Embark on I don't know which is gonna be best. I think what's needed There is some soul-searching like I really need to find out what I want to do. I really hope. This is happened for a good reason. You know I kind of believe that things happen for a reason to say there's got to be a reason behind this when other things like this happen. I just doubt myself and I'm like I'm not good enough it makes me doubt everything and anything I do and I'm just I'm not good enough and it doesn't make you feel great about yourself being rejected. However, I don't want to finish this video on a bad note. I'm so sorry. I've just been crying and sniffing this whole way through like I was super annoying to myself. I wanted this video to be you know not wishy-washy but it's. She washing anyway? It's okay essentially that I've been rejected it's fine Holly. It's just a rejection on a piece of paper. It's so ridiculous. I'm gonna be talking probably a lot now about what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna be really trying to think hard about what's gonna be best. I hope that any of you guys have also faced rejection. I mean I hope that you've got over it and if you are facing a reduction of any kind at the moment that we can relate but it's gonna be okay. It's not the end of the world essentially I don't really have anything else to say other than thank you for watching if you mean it to the end of this video. Then I salute you don't speak to very soon. Another video that won't be me crying you'll be glad to hear because a life. is too short to sit here and cry thanks guys for watching a speech and face you.\",\n",
       " \"Hey guys and welcome back to my channel. I never thought I would say this but I have done my final year exams five exams in five days wow. It was a crazy week and I wanted to take you guys along with me so we started on Monday and this is post exam one is down I'm a fifth of the way through but it's one down Oh my gosh breathe calm hello guys. I have not spoke to the Cameron so long and I can't even tell you how stressed I have been I've never known Leben this just on [UNK] I've been crying. I'm a nervous wreck. This morning I was shaking. I could not physically stop myself from shaking. I don't know why I know what they loved me but these exams have been stressful. They are still stressful. I am now currently in the middle. of like fantasies in my week of exams five days five exam Monday to Friday and I feel a lot better now that I have done one it's so weird. You just have to break the ice and do one and then you feel a bit better about them. The sooner we start the sooner. We finish okay anyway so um let's have an update charts. Oh battery's dying already bye Oh I have just done my classics. I have one of the big like the big ones with two 90-minute questions where I just wrote two essays in this exam. I had to choose from three each section. How did it go first exam so I don't know it's okay that's but they might always say an exam that's kind of okay my hand kind of hurts now I've got really hot halfway through it Just like were. Ripped off mine on a jumper and pillow saw I was a bit like Oh my gosh, but yeah! It was quite hot in this room, but other than that it was. It was a semi-okay like the first question. The first essay. I felt okay about I planned it. We got it down. Maybe it's been a bit too long a bit over the time I should've so I moved on to the next section. Here's the little issue that hiccup we had one of the questions I rolled out straight away. I was like no because the last pot depression. I was a bit lat well. Yeah remember to buy shirts and I was like Hmm. I was like you know in the exam and despair the moment you're best dressed you're like how much one so I decided to do one of that brand it broke. the whole introduction okay a whole introduction and then I was just like no no because I didn't think that I had anything extra to put into that essay. I like this show it's all focus I'm like an extra reading, but yeah I couldn't think of anything because it's quite intricate topic anyway and I was just like no. So I read the introduction. I kind of waited a bit time helps my issue and then moves on to the other one. I didn't really plan other one I just like went straight and was just like you know we're just gonna dive into the deep end and it's had okay, but it wasn't so fresh in my brain because they've revised host of our judge. My brain is by kind of like throwing some stuff that was extra. I thought there was extra. So I thought that that. Would you know like get me a few extra Brownie points that was my rationale for radically changing question wasn't like awful I don't thank me. I'll say like hopefully not I could have written more like I was more. I would like to have said if another, but they're like five minutes reading I was like it's to unite de Menezes down now if you today and tour are gonna be the worst days because I have a [UNK] a.m. exam tomorrow so yeah It's kind of like five I'm gonna go to run that's what I'm gonna do because I mean [UNK] see a break to get my brain a little bit of a rest and then come back with more forensics. Arm is the same module so be cancer immunology, but it will be a different set up and they'll be like four essays simple to moment. essays so they'll be a bit more like specific it sounds like these broad questions. I don't know why I'm like doing this so yeah That's my update exam season D1. I couldn't face the camera before this exam because I said I was just so stressed and nervous, but what you do want it definitely does something like something clicks and you know okay we're in exam season can't change you just got to do it there's my lovely board still up like in my stress of packing my bag I put in some tissue but then I put in my pencil case and I was like no. I can take down to the exams. I think I'm cheating I'm I'm not cheating it. Some last-minute flashcards in [UNK] me often just like pork and chill Sammy chill before the exam is he and I prefer not to parameter. Exam kind of like to give our brains a rest and we've done that for three years and it's kind of worked for us. We just character. You know calm each other down so we have them it chopped it down when I started my run and so it turned back because it lets you pour down and then a few seconds like got bite widgets dropped all that so I went to the gym and there's some stuff in that bit. I'm gonna take them out which is really wet but basically. I think if I go find the new topics. I'm revising the topics that I have not come up. I'm just gonna drop topics now because unlikely that they will ask a similar question that's the P okay that evening was pretty stressful because I knew that I had an exam at [UNK] a.m. the next day. But I tried to revise in the most effective way so for me. This involves writing things down from memory on scrap pieces of paper using flashcards, drilling stuff, making sure that I can say it off by heart and in that way. I can ensure that it's actually in my brain and I'm not relying on my notes. So I just had my folders out and I was going through the topics. I felt as if I didn't know about it very well all those I would like to come up in the exam. There is currently a thunderstorm and I keep seeing flashes of lightning coming from under my curtains. Oh my gosh it looks like the scariest thing. I've never heard Louder Thunder and not gonna lie. I'm going to get this undone. It's like chucking it down as well. I'm currently trying to make overnight so. Tomorrow because I have 90 M under 24 hours between exams not great like afternoon exam than 90 M and a thunderstorm to go with but yeah let's be Crates under okay Okay Second day changed a less good pre-exam breakfast and an apple feeding my brain. They just pulled my oats into this bowl and thought it was late to fruit well. It's a flaxseed that's me for my morning breakfast exam number two Oh my gosh and I've done more than half of my degree more than half because my dissertation I have already done that and it is more than my minor module, which I have to work over halfway through just to let you walk to the door and I should just go silly and yes I am wearing the same clothes. I will probably be wearing the same place throughout the whole week, so yeah. started with my jump up Oh this time, so I didn't get too hot and that is definitely the way forwards for these next few exams. So this one. I wrote four essays 45 minutes each, which is actually not very long scribbling so hard all right until the end. So we picked two questions from each section and I mean they were okay not enough time for right. I really wanted just write more and more but you know time constraints. I hope it was okay. I had my interesting conclusions. I didn't plan them because I didn't feel as if I had time and for two of them through the essays. I wrote I'd kind of done plans for so I knew the structure I was aiming for which is so great and then the others. I was like no we're just gonna dive in and it turned. out okay hopefully so just unpack, busy bag pencil case and flash baths I didn't look at as always here is the lovely exam paper let's just like not looking at put it somewhere away. So my next exam is biochemistry and that's tomorrow afternoon so this is the longest kind of in the war between two exams. I don't have any more morning which is so good because that's just a bit of a tight turnaround. Also the most frustrating thing is that the amount of information that you try and learn okay so there's so much information that I am trying to learn. I have my flashcards war there's more stuff here like everything that you try and learn you learn so much and cram it in and the amount that you get to write and you get to go to the examiner that you know the amount. That you actually write down on the paper is teeny weeny tiny, but yeah, I'm gonna phone mum about her nine how it was so. I didn't get drenched in the rain today, but it was spitting, but it was kind of refreshing and then I went to the gym after I'm said my abs and stuff which I'm done in a while so I thought hello abdominal muscles. I'm not gonna be making lunch and I'm trying to mix this almond butter because I'm making myself like toasted Rye bread. I am such a lover of toasted Rye bread, and when it's a bit burn like random bits of fruit some cucumber. You know me. I should have everything random in One Bowl if you're a bit confused and you haven't really seen that many of my videos then you might not actually know why study and what I. Do so I'm going to try and explain I do Biology and I take this year a major subject and a minor subject. The minor subject in which is what I was revising for this evening is biochemistry and I take one exam in my minor and then find major subject that is in pathology, but I do two modules within pathology. So one of them is immunology and the other one is cancer and genetic disease. It gets even more complicated because the cancer and genetic disease module which I call [UNK] is split into two parts. The first one is cancer [UNK] stuff and the second bit is genetics, but there is obviously crossover and yeah. So I then take for exams and we made for pathology and both have immunology and [UNK] and I am so tired Wow it has hit me hard. I don't know my. Brain just feels like a massive fog. It's not headache, but it just feels full like to follow information and I'm just sensing here. I'm trying to go through stuff and it's just like not going in. I'm just feel as I'm so tired so I think I really just go to bed. Super early today get up tomorrow my exams in the afternoon and yeah because Wow oh okay three more days there you have to push through and I spoke to dad and he really just need to get sleep unless so dude. I need to get sleep. I cannot burn out. You might have noticed there's this massive thing on the side of my lip. It's not food that's not cold or cold slow pulse or I never know what that board anyway it's not one of those it's a cart that essentially won't heal yeah that's. beautiful the consoling ah wake up wake up alright So I'm actually going to bed a bit earlier than usual. I've been going to bed at about [UNK] every night. It's currently like 15 minutes before [UNK], but that's better so I have these kind of like shape things that I use it's again at playing paper, but I essentially write down the topic or the exam. So this is my biochemistry one and then I write down the things I remember I look at it before I go to bed net hopes cuz it kind of goes into my mind if I look at it just before I go to bed. I always have ones like this stuff or like one topic in particular and it's got a bit more information on it, but yeah I just like to have these that I can just look up and I. Find I relate this for yeah the best happy hump day anyone could ever ask for few topics. I'm trying to go over like the majority of topics this morning. This is like kind of quickly as I can that's why I kind of try and do before the morning for an exam if I have it in the afternoon the other day. I tried to go through like two whole modules in the morning and it just didn't happen but I chemistry. There's not that many well there are a few topics, but I'm trying to go through quite. She doesn't taste quite right yeah I just don't me I'm gonna rest eat in this and then like making myself feel well as much as I hate all throughout exam season and pretty much in general I will drink a smoothie for breakfast and then I usually have oats. For lunch especially during exam season and high stress periods, I like to have my set meals and my go to so it's a green smoothie and then as you can see at the moment I was mind mapping something so this is just a way to write down everything that I know and focus on the stuff that I maybe don't know so I just like to brainstorm in that way. I find wine maps are really useful for essay plans and for trying to organize your notes or organize your thoughts on one topic. That is what I was just doing for biochemistry. I was trying to go through as much as possible as I said and obviously because my major module has cancer stuff in it there is quite a bit overlap which is really useful, so does another exam. I've already changed you love just this. Speaking to Mom I was gonna speech you guys before Mike Sam I was a bit rushed and I was already late meeting is I was just like trying to revise like really quickly but didn't even come up in the end Yeah the exam It was like hey. One question was so broad. It was basically like time We get a cancer hello to write an essay now about that I had so much I wanted to say and I got to write like it's much but yeah I try to get as much doubt is the last that ever I don't like scribbling to the end. Although the questions were like a lot more focused. I was how the exam is that you do to that are focused. I'm one of those very broad and I'm now done with my chemistry my minor it's done all I have. Now is two more times left I just think sense freedom Oh my gosh and right now I'm already changed to go to the gym. It's raining outside again, which is super annoying, but I'm gonna go to the gym. I'm not I come back and guess what I really spoke to you guys this evening but I essentially went to the gym when I got back I've just been revising kind of sense so my exam tomorrow again three hours and the 90-minute assays do we have another 90-minute one for Amy Ology and we always have the genetics part module so yeah These questions for the genetics one they tend to be a lot more obscure so a bit worried that they're gonna be really mean but I'm trying not to think negatively. I'm just trying to think something like that I dunno stuff I'm telling myself. knew stuff I have mentioned before like the genetic stuff of my [UNK] module. It's not my favorite but like I can't think pessimistically and Yeah I'm just got a hope. Questions are okay, so I can write something for 90 minutes, which is quite a long time. Actually the other day both for 90 minutes exams the other day. I'm still like I want more time Yeah I'm gonna get in the shower now go got more vision I'm going bad I get worried restart day number for an exam number four. There we go you know yeah I'm still wearing same jump on it's got to face today. New edition I was a bit stressed before this exam bullying. That is why I just didn't film anything other than waking up at [UNK] a.m. But yeah this exam okay, So I had a slight panic attack when I read the questions. I probably had this enough to the genetic stuff as I said and I read the first question and was like what even those I mean that didn't even make sense to me. So I moved to the second one and there's a choice of three and I was like what I thought that was not gonna come up because I think similar came at large halls. I'm not gonna realize that so I was like no so I moved to the third question. I'm thank goodness I could do that one. However, I was writing the essay. I did my plan and they kept doubting myself. It's been like is this answering the question. I'm sure it was but you don't even the exam sassing and you're just like doubting yourself, But I did the essay when obviously I start the exam. I also pick the essay that I'm gonna do for me Knology as well. I read them really quickly and I was. I can't go to through the first one and it was about like bacteria and stuff and vaccines and I was a bit like mm not really feeling that much but if I have to do I'll do it do when I finish the first steps Annals I came uh smoother than hat all right the question semiology again second one. I was definitely not gonna do because I had no clue how I could write about that for like it in 90 minutes based on what they told us. I had no extra reading for as well I read. The third one, I was like actually my light bulb moment. I was like I can do that question and I can actually use stuff that everyone for my designation for it. So I was like let's do that so I swapped from doing bacteria to therapeutics and using the immune system, which was actually quite good as it's right this toothpaste is very distracting another exam done is the reasonable thing. Yeah I was really stressed fighting for this one just because the genetic stuff was freaking me out. I was so scared and then when I saw that question name I was like gonna cry oh right I'm gonna call mum. The usual in my eyes is going about bloodshot. I suddenly feel really hay fever [UNK] I just went on a run and I was fine until I got back and I was stretching out on the. Rooftop Button and my eyes just started to get really itchy so yeah Hey Theo just hold off one more day and then you can come at me full force After every exam. Whether that be in the morning or in the afternoon. I would do some physical form of activity out either go on a run and that was third option. If it wasn't raining so that I could get fresh air but otherwise. I would then go to the gym it just means I can finish my exam and clear my mind a bit before I then start for the next again. I was mind mapping and trying to write stuff down from memory and I did that I did some drills before I then made my dinner. So I would every day make all of my food as well. In college I didn't go to buttery I've. Never actually been to buttery in my three years shock horror guys, but yeah! I did myself loads of vegetative greens, which is so important to me, and then I was making myself one of my favorite meals, which you can probably guess. I want you guys to guess what do you think I was making other than the veg. It has been a long time since I'm in the kitchen with you guys but anyway. I have made myself my dinner it's very typical you probably know it is is this dripping in my food, but yeah one of my favorite meals. I basically have just been doing like really quick easy meals obviously during exam seasons, but still eerily good food to me. This is like the best meal of brown rice, chickpeas and veg and then over like teeny, which seem to land all in this position. And that is my dinner memories gloves are dripping. Also I always add tumeric just over the top and you guys always told me. I should mix it and cook it with the food which I am totally aware of I just forget a reasonable time, but after he sounds like you focus and think of it more clearly about what I'm doing so just like going into autopilot. We've done am eating food which is why I don't do I never thought I would make it this far but Friday the last day. Oh [UNK] [UNK] Oh my god I have finished honey won't believe it I am done like my degree. I have done it everything. I I I just she caught me this week and it hasn't even sunk in that I have finished these inc sounds like I so I would cry you really upset I'm. Just like well this guy's is how you'd finish your exams got some fizzy lemonade Paul. You believe it the exams right to talk about the exam because it doesn't even matter now, but it wasn't the best exam The questions what particularly good but we did it and we are now done and that was it I kind of drank my lemonade and celebrated by going to a formal which is basically just a semi-fancy dinner in college shout out to Lucy. It was her birthday and she has to take an exam on that day, but yeah five exams guys in five days. I never thought I would actually finish and get to the end. It felt like I have been running a marathon or like climbing a huge mountain and I never thought I'd actually finish them and survived, but we did it it feels really. Where that still doesn't feel right that I finished and I've technically done everything I can for this degree thank you as always for watching please like it if you enjoyed it and I will speak to you very soon guys bye you.\",\n",

       " \"well former First Lady Michelle Obama thank you for being here to talk with us about your new book thanks for having me. The book is called the light we carry overcoming in uncertain times and I have to tell you I read becoming and this is a really different book. Becoming was obviously this very intimate peeling back the layers of your personal story. Your family story that I think so many people have wanted to know for so long and but this book is it's more practical it's like a guidebook almost yeah I call it a tool kit I mean I think I'm like everybody Over the last few years we have been struggling um you know economic uncertainty, a pandemic isolation Uh Injustice. It's kind of left us all feeling out of sorts and so I get a lot of questions from people. It's like how. Do I cope and given my motto When they go low We go high A lot of people these days have been struggling to figure out how to stay high when it feels like the world is in a low place and so this book is my best attempt at offering people at least an a look into my toolbox. The practices and habits the people who keep me balanced and hopefully. It'll start a conversation because I think that that's a lot of what we're feeling we've been locked away from one another and we're feeling disconnected and we need to get back together and uncover ourselves with each other and figure out how do we adapt in an inevitably uncertain world. One of the things that you said in this book is that when you released becoming several years ago, it was like a breath of fresh air. After the time that your family spent in the white house So I'm curious to you as you're about to set off on your book tour as you're bringing this book into the world if that was a big breath. If that was a release. What does this process feel like ah you know whenever you are putting yourself out into the public. I am no different it is frightening yeah, you know I mean I I talk about in this book how even though becoming was a breath of fresh air There's Something about making yourself vulnerable in the world. We may make it look easy, but we still go through that doubting process did I share too much um. How will people receive the truth that I have to offer um so. You know I'm in that same place with Uh with this book My Hope Is that people will find something useful in it and I have been I've spent my time alone with this book. Uh talking with myself and with the few people that I've let look at it now I'm sharing these thoughts do they make sense do they connect with people do they resonate. I don't know so that there is still a fear a doubt a vulnerability that goes into any project that I take on um so I'm feeling a little nervous you know what strikes me when I'm reading the book is you get vulnerable not just about yourself, but you talk about your marriage. We learn about the fact that your daughters are now dating were you. You talk about this idea of being comfortably afraid of really being able to harness that fear were you how did you think about the things that you shared with all of us with your readers about your family's lives you know I I always have to strike a balance of how much Uh sharing will help people and how do I make sure that I'm protecting my family's privacy Um, but I think about my writing like I think about everything else I learn from stories Um I I never want to produce anything that feels a didactic finger-pointing all I have is my own authentic truth. Um so I I feel like if I'm coming from that place and I've gotten the permission of my family members. Then I feel like a okay. There's a lesson here so when I talk about my relationship with my husband it's. I know that there are a lot of young people who are trying to figure out how do you what is a marriage? How do you shape a relationship? I am fascinated by how little we talk to young people, young adults about what it actually means to partner with somebody and what those compromises look like and you know pushing them to answer questions for themselves of what are you trying to get out of this relationship with this other person Have you thought it through are you seeking a wedding or do you want a relationship? Those are two very different things, so in the chapter that's called partnering well again. I share my journey with my husband. The things that stuck out for me. What I was trying to find in another person and how that worked out over the the course of 30 years we have. We are now celebrating our 30th anniversary with the hopes that you know it will create a conversation among the next generation of people trying to start to build their lives. What do you look for in a partner? What do you have to bring to a relationship yourself in order to make it whole and healthy. I got something that so many people are curious about people. I think and you've written about this they've idealized your marriage they sit there and look at it. But you have always been very clear out and very honest that marriage makes work. It takes daily work and that it is not always glamorous and you have had some very unique strains. But there's also the strains that any of us who are in a relationship or married face whether it be whose career goes first or who takes on the child. care labor? How do you think about? Is there one piece of advice that you would give for people who are thinking about how you put in that work for a partnership that's lasted that yeah it's not really one piece of advice. It's to me it's a philosophy it's an Outlook. Um. You know in in this age of we want everything now we want everything quick. We you know when life is everything but that um marriage is we have to understand that marriage is never 50 50. Um and you know you sort of wonder how that idea kind of got out there. Um I have found that if you stick with it. You know over the course of your entire relationship. You may have 50 50 over time, but if I look over my marriage if I were to judge it in year five or year. 10 There was never 50 50. Somebody was always giving way more someone always needed a different kind of thing. You have to evolve with it and so yeah Yeah! There were times when I felt like I was 70 percent in and he was doing 30 percent Um, But I think that and and I've had to compromise Uh as he has. I've had to because of the choices that I made in the terms of how I wanted our family to look. I had to take my foot off of my career gas pedal Uh never putting on the break but slowing up a little bit Um. Those are the natural compromises that are required and I feel bad when I see young people giving up on their relationships. Because there's there are periods of hard. There are periods of discomfort Um as I have told young people. Who ask me about marriage? I was like you have to be prepared to have long stretches of discomfort and long. I mean it could last for years and don't put kids into the equation because that's just another layer of complication. You love them to death, but they will shake take your marriage up and turn you both upside down. So I think it's important for us to be honest in those conversations not to glamorize what a partnership feels like because then young people quit too soon they quit before they've really you know played out the full scenario so one of the things that I loved that was a through line that ran throughout this book is the the revolving relationships between parents and children and particularly mothers and daughters and you wrote a lot about your relationship with your mom who we all know played a pivotal role with living with your family during your years in the white house. I'm curious what has that been like for me as your relationship has evolved into being both adults now having adult children what does that look like for me. I think it's a beautiful Journey. You know um one of the things I share some of the you know sort of Uh unique brand of wisdom that my my parents brought to their parenting. I share that in the book but something I admired about my mother is that you know she had a clear philosophy about parenting, which is unusual for somebody of her generation. There weren't all the what to expect books and the Doctor Who Do you do books on how to parent, but there were just some a common sense way that approach that she brought to Parenting, but she always talked about she said I'm I'm not raising children. I'm raising adults Um and so I always had an interestingly open and honest conversation with my parents. They encouraged us to talk at an early age to find our voices. She made sure we felt heard she made sure that. She took our concerns and issues seriously. We were never treated as kids should be seen and not heard so when you have that Foundation you know your relationship is always I feel at least with my mother and I've tried to do that with my daughters has been on a steady course of growth, but you still have to be ready for your your kids to evolve. You know who they are at four and seven is not what and what they need from you is very different from what they need from you as teenagers and then again as young women, but if you've laid a foundation of trust and honesty every stage I found is is wonderful. It's full it's exciting. I don't miss any stage. I I loved every stage of parenting my girls, but I wouldn't go back to any no of the stages I. Don't long for the time when they were babies. I love that time breastfeeding when you you know you could sit and hold them and look at them forever, but now that they're young women you know and now I'm less of a day-to-day manager and more of an advisor. There's a there's a freedom to enjoy them as individuals to watch them grow and I think that's been the case for me and my mom as well with your girls, though has that been comfortable for you. The idea of stepping back from that manager role and letting them lead letting them be the people who make you and your husband as you say weak Martinis when you come and visit their apartment that I couldn't stop laughing when I read that you know well that's that it is a hard thing to do to let your kids be. know in this era of helicopter parenting you know where I think parents are very maybe overly involved in their kids lives Um I was raised to be handed my competence early. You know my mother raised her as I write in the book. She says her job is to put herself out of a job early so she started at a very early age, requiring us to be independent. You know as early as kindergarten. She gave us alarm clocks because she knew that we were capable of getting ourselves up. She wanted us to feel the power of our competence. So from five years old. I was setting an alarm soon thereafter. I was walking to school by myself and what that does for a kid. When your parent trusts you you know it it it encourages you. It tells you that if my mom thinks I can. Do this then? I must be capable and I've tried to instill that same kind of Stand by the gate and watch your kids fly be there for them when they come back. Let them know that you will be their Advocate, but don't step in and try to live their lives for them and so when I see my kids flourishing in that way. When I see them owning all their choices and succeeding and failing on their own terms and growing from that process. It is one of the most satisfying experiences. It is frightening. It is frightening to watch your children walk into a brick wall, but that's what growth is and you know and too many parents try to stop that process, but that's the quickest way for them to learn to learn from owning their mistakes and owning their victories at the same time but. You got to get adjusted? I mean I talk about how you know when you're letting your kids go you're letting your heart out there in the world that Barack and I kind of do this kind of crazy parent text check-in you know like writing things that are keeping us up at night. Barack one one day sent them a text on earthquake preparedness because they now live in [UNK] and it's that's the kind of thing you do as a parent. You think Uh oh there are earthquakes have I warned them are they prepared so in the middle of the night. He's sending Some article on a 10-step plan that includes you know getting earthquake training and stocking up on water and the response from one of my daughters was okay which of these things do you think we should do because it's a lot right but that's our own anxiety playing itself out um you know what did I miss you know what more can I feed into you to make sure that you're safe and sound and secure but the truth of the matter is that we we don't control that and as a parent that's a hard thing to come to grips with as your child is you is your child grows up and is out there in that big bad world is that you can prepare and love them all all that you can and you still don't have control. There are no guarantees that their life is going. work out and something bad may happen That is the hardest thing about parenting is living with that truth. But the alternative is to stop them from growing and that in my view would be the sad outcome if my kids were sitting safe in my basement or in their rooms at home. Uh with me feeling comforted in the fact that I knew what they were doing and where they were but not owning their own lives. I think that would be the sadder outcome. So I have to remind myself of that you know when I get the urge to step in Uh, but that's why I tell people parenting is hard it isn't just hard because it's hard. It's hard because it's emotionally you are in your most vulnerable space. Um now I could go on and on. But I do write about a lot of that. In the book, one of the other things you touch on in the book is you are very open and candid about acknowledging the fact that you have support and you have help and you have had help throughout your life in raising your children and you point find out that any High earning successful women who report to have it all and do it all they've got help so I want to ask you what disservice do we do to people particularly women and caregivers When we don't all acknowledge and aren't as transparent about the fact that we have help, especially given that we are coming out of a two-to three-year period that is exposed so much strain in our caregiving infrastructure in this country well that's the you know the the Trope that we wear as women that we're supposed to be able to do. It all um you know and I don't know where that came from you know when I look back on the women in my life. You know it was a real necessity. You know the the matriarchs of our household did do it all as black women with men whose opportunities were limited because of Jim Crow and segregation. You know where a black man was more of a threat so a black woman could you know have a more consistency in their earning potential, but still had to hold down the traditional wife and mother role of cooking and child rearing you know if I look back over my personal history. I can see where you know that's what was modeled to us that the mothers in our lives did everything you know they mother they worked. They took care of the home. So we're emulating that particularly as women of color. You know that's that's a sign of strength. You know so we don't ask for help. We are not conditioned to think that that that's not a weakness um so yes. I think it's a disservice when those of us who are out here modeling it aren't being real clear about the fact that we are not meant to do this life alone. We are not meant. I believe we were not meant to parent alone. You know the whole concept of a nuclear family. You know just me my husband If you're Lucky and the kid kids and this is our unit and we live independently that's a fairly new phenomenon to our generation. You know for Uh decades people have lived in extended family units. You know I wrote about that into coming. I grew up in a community surrounded by family members. I had maternal grandparents around the corner paternal grandparents. Uh you know down the street we lived above the home of a great aunt. We saw each other regularly our families cousins together almost every weekend celebrating birthday parties and and I can't think of a time where I had to have a babysitter because there was just always somebody that was chipping in somebody would pop over you'd go over somebody else's house so now here we sit in our generation many of us have moved away from our. family units, our communities of support and we're off in some city with a big job still trying to emulate what our our grandparents and grandmothers and fathers did that doesn't work you know you need if you're working outside of the home. Because we all are working inside of the home. You know there is no um shame in in getting support your your kids will value it they will value you being less stressful now the guilty part of that piece. If you're a woman who has the resources is that we all know women who don't have that choice so sometimes we hide it because it's like dag how am I talking about a Nanny and this and that when I know that there are women my peers my my cousins my who don't have that support. They're doing just as much as I'm doing, but they. Can't afford they Don't have access to affordable child care they couldn't think of having a nanny. You know they Don't have flexibility in their work schedule. So part of it is that there's a kind of survivor's remorse about what you're able to do. But I think we still have to talk about the fact that family units have to be based on a big community of support there is um. There is uh nothing particularly Courageous about doing life alone. You know um but you know if we if if those of us who are doing it aren't being honest about how hard that is and what it takes to actually get it right. Then we're mirroring the wrong things for the generation to come and I don't want to do that to my girls. You know Yeah? One of the things that you walk through in the book and you talk about a number of the ways in which your life and the journey that your family has been on has been incredibly exceptional, but you also talk about some incredibly relatable experiences such as the isolation of being the only whether it is the only woman of color. The only black person in the room of being the only person who didn't come for money at a college and I wonder now all these years later in the journey that you have been on Do you still feel that way sometimes and how do you deal with it Yeah honestly of course as Michelle Obama, You know I feel it less acutely um but that's fairly recent. You know I mean when we were in the white house we were the the first. And the only at many tables of power Um watching people adjust to that Um That was very reminiscent of the experiences that I had you know going to college and practicing in a corporate law firm and sitting around board UH seats and on and on and on Um. But what I found is over time and I write about this is that you know we can't change that reality Um we are still sadly breaking barriers right. I mean it is unfortunate that Uh. The percentages of students of color on college campuses is remaining relatively sadly stagnant. The same is true and if you look at corporate law. The numbers of Associates and partners in large firms has not really significantly increased Um so we still are struggling to make progress. So in the meantime, we're dealing with the reality of the fact that yeah we're still. trying to fill those seats so how do we get through in the meantime Um because when you're an only there's uh as I describe it. There's a a feeling of walking around trying to navigate a a town or a city with a road map that doesn't fit you know you're playing a game with someone else's rules Um you feel isolated and disconnected sometimes outside of your own body and what happens when that occurs is that you start feeling self-conscious you spend more time thinking about your loneliness. You're carrying that burden rather than focusing on the task at hand, and that is that makes overcoming all that just even more difficult Um what I had to learn to do was to first get out of my own head not easy. Though it's not. It is not an easy thing to do and it takes practice but. of what this book is reminding us is that there are no Miracle answers to these things overcoming imposter syndrome. Feeling like you belong right um there isn't a. This is. These are the three steps you take to feeling seen right doesn't happen that way for me. I have practiced trying to get out of my head for 58 years Now. It is a daily reminder that I have to uh take the mask that I am trying to hold up on my face take it down so that I can see what I'm doing and by mask. I mean stop trying to stop pretending to be something that I'm not trying to fit in and leave behind the parts of me that make me real and authentic stop worrying about how I wear my hair and what somebody is going to think about it. You know stop thinking. about how I conjugate my verbs or what stories I tell about myself to make me fit into somebody else's world that gets in we get in our way with that. But it takes practice and I open the book by urging young people to read it to understand that patience is an important tool in in developing your own set of tools. What I am able to do now. The messages that I tell myself now at 58 are very different than what I needed to say to myself at 20.. But I know now have a lifetime of understanding that I have been practicing through being the only of quieting my doubtful mind and then speaking up and using my experiences as the source code as I say to the power that I actually have and bring you know it doesn't happen overnight, but we have to keep. Telling ourselves I am going to show up in the world as my authentic self and that is good enough that's the work that we have to do. I wish. There were shortcuts Um, but it is what it is you mentioned patience and that is something that I've been wanting to ask you about you mentioned earlier. The call to action that many of us know you for when they go low. We go high and in a past life before I had this job. I was a political correspondent and I spent a lot of time traveling this country and talking to young people in particular and what I heard a lot and I'm sure you hear this too from the people who write you letters or come to events that you hold is the fact that they want to believe in a world of going high but. They feel a sense of urgency oftentimes. They express that they feel a sense of Rage given all of the hurt and harm and marginalization. The INsurrection attacks on LGBtQ rights [UNK] I could the list the laundry list could go on. How does going high square with the urgency that so many people feel especially young people feel In This Moment well that's the interesting thing because young people interpret some young people interpret going high as being complacent. You know going going high doesn't mean sitting on the side of the road and watching you know Injustice go by going high is about having a strategy a real concrete strategy for change. It's taking the rage and turning it into reason so that you can actually be heard and move toward change so when I think about going high. I'm usually thinking at a time when I'm feeling. the rage and I feel the need to react I I've learned to ask myself am I indulging my rage is what I'm about to do or say gonna make me feel good in the short term, but have no impact over the long term right because the goal is the impact. Ultimately you know um that's what Barack and I had to do every day in the White House you know I used to play this game with my communication staff before an interview or something where we would sort of walk through the questions and there'd be some question that would be what I call a knucklehead question you know and I'd I'd practice my true response right my I shouldn't say true my gut response because sometimes just playing it out loud helps to get it out, but then when you put your your first gut reaction. out there for the world to see in here and then you look at it for a minute and you go ah well that's not even how I really feel you know um and what's going to be the outcome you know there's going to be half the country that won't even hear the rest of the the solution. If I start there if I start with my rage and anger all I will do is play out my rage and anger but I won't be able to affect any change going high is about the ultimate goal of where are we trying to go and what's the best way to get there and over the course of history, especially the history of civil rights. There was the rage but there was always the plan you know the March on Washington was the cherry on top after Decades of legislative. Action and strategic sit-downs? You know the March wasn't the it wasn't the beginning or the end and that's what we have to figure out. What is the true beginning and where are we trying to get to There is room for rage in that you know there's there's and there's urgency in that the other thing. I try to remind young people is that um it's easy to look at what your press predecessors have done and to say not enough why not why not faster, why not better why not bigger and what I say is young people aren't wrong to feel that that's that's why folks need to get out of the way and pass on you know pass on the power to the Next Generation but what we can't lose sight of is that every generation in this movement toward whatever change they are they are. the marker that they can at the time they are working within the confines with the doubts in their heads, The the history that they come from we do ourselves no good by being mad because the folks aren't our team didn't do more people are doing what they can do with what they have and I can guarantee you that this generation of young people that are complaining about the lack of urgency will get to our age and their kids will look at them and say why'd you do more faster the nature of change it. It is a slog it is a marathon and it will never feel like enough because until everything is perfect. It will always be urgent, but in the meantime, what I urge young people to do is be be be rageful you you and own it, but have a plan have a strategy that can work. Um know what it is be thoughtful about that approach and make sure that what you say is really what you mean and how you feel over the long term and not just today. You know it strikes me as you write about how imperative. It is that we should still go high that we have we're coming out of this period where all of us have faced so many challenges. Um Tomorrow. Former President Trump is expected to announce that he's going to run for president yet again. Um and I just wonder you talk about this toolbox what goes through your head and what tools do you reach for when you think. about something like that Oh, I, I, I and my husband helps me with this. I I think about the context of the history of our country of our world and I realize that you know this is a moment. This is a moment and we cannot let a moment turn us so upside down that we can't function You know um the the the ARc of change doesn't just go straight up. It goes up and down and up and down and so in these moments I tell myself. I ask myself and this is a chapter that I I call the power of small all right. What can I do in this moment that I can uniquely control When I think something's about to happen that I cannot control right Um voting is one of those things you know it doesn't feel like a lot you know it's. a small action that happens on a Tuesday Uh every couple of years would happen more if people voted more and focused on their local elections too um but that's one of those things you know if you if you don't like the guy that's running the power that we have in our democracy. However, small it is is that we each have the responsibility and the right to vote at least right now so let us exercise it you know so that we're we're not in a position to take it for granted and have those rights snatched away because let me tell you if we don't if we don't use them if we don't protect them fiercely even when the person who won isn't somebody that we agree with we will lose those rights we've seen it with uh abortion rights we've seen it we've experienced it I. Can't tell you how many times we got on the campaign Trail over the last eight years and said this election is important you know because the Supreme Court is at risk. You know it matters who's on the Supreme Court Roe V Wade is you know is in jeopardy and watching election after election people not turning out you know um because they didn't like that guy They were mad about the fact why is he even running you know and it's not necessarily Trump but anybody right. The governor's race the [UNK] attorney you know we sit out we don't we don't do the work because we're mad about who's in um. We have this small power each of us to shape the direction of the country and if we don't use it. You know I I mean I I you know I I never want to throw. my hands up, but I think what what are we going to do in this democracy if we quit on it for my First Lady Michelle Obama thank you so much for spending some time with us today thank you, it's been a real pleasure thanks so much.\",\n",
       " \"Karl Marx is often described as one of the greatest thinkers of the 19th century. His writings have inspired revolutions and generated centuries of fierce debate. Born in Prussia, now Germany in May 1818 Marx believed that capitalism, which was in its infancy at the time had serious flaws. Marx claimed that in pursuit of profit capitalists would encourage their ideology that work is good, leisure is bad and material things will make us happy embracing mass production depriving workers of job satisfaction At the same time exploiting the working-class. He became involved in the Communist League, a small group of intellectuals who wanted to abolish the class system and spread wealth equally. Marx wrote the communist manifesto in 1847 with his benefactor Friedrich Engels laying out the Marxist vision of a society where wealth was distributed evenly property is owned publicly and education is free for all but Marx. Little known and little read at the time when he died in 1883, only eleven people attended his funeral. After his death. His ideas flourished based on the theory of Marxism came communism. The realization of a stateless society where all are equal. Communism became a global movement, but the utopian ideal of a fair and equal society failed to materialize communism, terrorized and impoverished its subjects and slaughtered them in the tens of millions. Today Capitalism dominates the world, but many of Marx's criticisms have never been more relevant today. The global disparity between rich and poor is striking. Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to the rich getting richer and the poor staying Paul He was right. He also predicted that capitalism would lead to boom and bust economics. Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to globalization and that a handful of firms would have huge market dominance. However, Marx underestimated the ability of capitalism to make everybody richer by making products much cheaper. Since the 1980s, the number of people in absolute poverty has fallen by about 1 billion. He also got wrong the capacity of capitalism to reform itself by creating welfare states that redistributed wealth through taxation. Although there is a lot to learn from Marx his solution was far worse than the disease. At the same time it can't be said that today's capitalism dominated by immense inequality and financial crises has triumphed you.\",\n",
       " \"2023 a year that many are facing with trepidation and whilst much of the world will be tightening its belt. There are plenty of ways in which 2023 is set to challenge assumptions from antique treasures and old-fashioned solutions to psychedelic Revelations and the fate of the world's. Biggest population. Here are five stories that may just transform the world ahead in 2023. The most populous country on the planet will no longer be China but India China's population is peaking, while India's has continued to grow and the [UNK] predicts that on April the 14th 2023. India's population will overtake that of China's that is hugely significant in symbolic terms, but what's more important is the composition of the Indian population, specifically the size of its working age population. India has more people of working age than any other population group. When this happens it can lead to what's. as a demographic dividend because of the opportunity it offers for economic growth particularly for developing countries take what happened in China. A population boom under MAo was followed by the introduction of the one child policy in 1979.. This created a big working age population with fewer children to raise providing the MAnpower for China's extraordinary economic expansion India's demographic bulge started much later than China's in the 2010s its forecast to continue to around 2050. with the biggest growth in the next decade is on this opportunity a bigger working age population in theory should mean greater productivity, but in India there are obstacles to its success for a start. About 90 percent of jobs in India are informal, which means the vast majority of workers Don't have a regular salary. Informal sector workers are quite productive. The problem is that these are very insecure jobs and so. We knew things like Kovid happened suddenly Many of these workers are out of work. So Indian government has been trying to set up some national pension schemes, health insurance benefits and so on, but Social Security benefits are quite limited for many of these workers what's more just 20 percent of women of working age are actually working. Part of the problem is that while girls are being educated to a higher level. It's often not high enough to work in offices, so what for these women in the regime it's quite difficult to find one for men of the same education. There are many jobs like truck drivers mobile phone repairers poster delivery workers. A lot of these occupations are not really open to women. Part of China's. Rapid economic growth was due to the foreign company's factories that were set up there. The Indian government has been. Trying to mimic this with a make in India campaign to entice foreign investment it's had some success in a big boost to India's manufacturing sector. Apple says that it plans to make the [UNK] 14 in India, but the country's infrastructure and the state of its Workforce remain a barrier. The proportion of the labor force that has any formal training is extremely small around three percent. There's very high level still of malnutrition, anemia and other health issues that means that a lot of people coming into the labor force, Cognitive and physical development may have been impaired. The challenge for the Indian government is to create the economic environment to encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to create jobs so that it can reap the rewards of being the most populous country on the planet 2023 could be the year that party drugs get closer to being. In your prescriptions with three different psychedelic drugs in Phase 3 trials to treat mental health conditions [UNK] could even be approved to treat post-traumatic stress disorder in America 2023 could potentially be a landmark year for us. This could be the first psychedelic assisted therapy approved by a regulatory body in any given year around 12 million Americans suffer from [UNK] and for some like veteran John Lubecky it can last many years. He was a participant in a phase [UNK] trial run by MAps [UNK], which has been developing [UNK] assisted therapy since 2004. you're experience me. It's kind of weird various periods of my life. The treatment combines three doses of [UNK] followed by Psychotherapy sessions. It's not just the [UNK]. It's not just the therapy. It's the two of them working together. The Results of our first pivotal phase three study thought at 67 percent of the people in the [UNK] group no longer met the criteria for having [UNK] FMdMa does get approved for [UNK] in 2023. It will be again for patients who really have limited options at the moment for treating this very difficult and this terrible condition psychedelics like [UNK] can make therapy much more effective. They can dampen activity in the part of the brain that processes fear and release feel-good hormones and neurotransmitters like serotonin which help reduce anxiety and increase empathy, making it easier for a patient to reflect on a traumatic experience. Psilocybin, Also known as Magic Mushrooms will also be in a phase 3 trial of a global study for treatment resistant depression that also has had a successful trial so far after having this therapy 12 weeks later, About one in five are in remission. A third drug normally associated with nightclubs is also in this critical final stage of testing. Ketamine-assisted therapy is showing promise in helping with alcohol use disorder. In the most recent study, 86 percent of patients were still abstained from alcohol six months after treatment already offered at awakens private clinics. Ketamine could eventually be regulated for General use in Britain We're seeing them being hyped as curals for lots and lots of different mental health conditions, and while I'm really excited about their promise. I do think it's really important that patients have realistic expectations about what they can achieve but all in all I. What we're looking at is 2023 is going to be a really pivotal year for psychedelic medicines Hello I'm Tom Standage, editor of the world ahead to read about the prospects for the coming year in more detail and get a head start on more of the themes and Trends to watch take out a subscription to The Economist, which includes full access to the world ahead 2023 to get the best offer click on the link and now on with the fill in 2023. There's one country which could make a global recession much worse. Japan Japan's the third largest economy and it's an important economy because its financial sector is intertwined with the financial sector of the rest of the world. Japan is the world's biggest creditor country. It holds trillions of dollars of assets overseas, which means what happens here has the potential to affect the world's. financial markets in recent years, Japan's Central Bank. The bank of Japan has been reassuring a predictable keeping interest rates low thanks to its very low inflation. Interest rates only have to go up when inflation Rises and that just hasn't happened so for a long time. Japan defied any predictions that it would have to raise interest rates or Titan monetary policy to the extent that betting that it would have to do that was a notorious way to lose money. It was a trade called the Widowmaker. It was always wrong even in the face of the pandemic and the energy crisis. The bank of Japan held fast thank you. The bank of Japan increasingly an outlier keeping its overnight interest rate at minus 0.1 percent. The Dovish tone continues Oh boy does it ever that is until now as interest rates have risen elsewhere in the world. Japan has found itself exposed by the widening GAp. The effect of that has been to make the Japanese currency. The Yen less attractive to International investors because if you buy the Yen and invest in the Japanese bond market. You're getting a lower interest rate lower return than if you invest in the [UNK] treasury market say, where you can benefit from those higher interest rates. As a result, the Yen has fallen against the dollar, making Imports more expensive for Japan which pushed up the rate of inflation so at the end of 2022 the bank of Japan did something unexpected it was all to do with the interest rate known as the yield on one particular form of Japanese government debt. Its 10-year bond. The yield on this bond is crucial in Japan because it affects a lot of economic activity, often borrowing by companies, mortgages and. kinds of contracts are related to long-term interest rates, so the idea is by keeping those interest rates low you stimulate spending and growth in the economy. The Japanese Central Bank has certainly done that by capping the yield of its 10-year bonds at 0.25 percent. The yield of a long-term Bond moves in the opposite direction to its price, so in order to keep the cap in place. The bank of Japan has been buying as many bonds as necessary. But in December 2022, the bank of Japan increased the cap to 0.5 percent. It might seem a relatively small move, but it was enough to destabilize the markets. Global markets were jolted overnight after the bank of Japan unexpectedly widened its cap on 10-year. Japanese government bond yields, and it was also an indication that in 2023 the bank of Japan might go even further the question is. could ditch the cap completely, but it could also start to increase short-term interest rates too as other central banks have done already. What's happened in 2022 is that central banks around the world and most importantly America's federal reserve have been raising interest rates and what that's meant is that there's been a growing gap between interest rates in JApan and in the rest of the world. The Federal Reserve for example, has increased interest rates from 0.25 percent at the start of 2022 to 4.5 percent at the end. But if interest rates in Japan climb the same distance. In 2023, it would be much more concerning because Japan has the highest level of public debt of any rich country. While interest rates were low high public debt was manageable, but if interest rates rise investors will start to worry that JApan might not be able to service. debt and start to sell their bonds, causing bond yields to go up Suddenly It's going to be more expensive for companies and for individuals to borrow. If there's a dramatic repricing in rates that can be quite destabilizing for the economy and because Japan is so intertwined with the rest of the world. This destabilization could spread to other financial markets, which means what the bank of Japan chooses to do in 2023 could make any Global recession much worse foreign it'll be back to the future for the fashion industry as make do and mend we'll be back on trend. Big clothing brands won't just be selling new clothes, but perhaps surprisingly also encouraging more wear out of old items too. Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and LVMh the world's biggest luxury group are all set to launch their own repair and resale services in 2023. It will all. be part of a wider push towards a more eco-friendly fashion industry today we are making more clothes than ever before, but we're using them less pretty much. The entire fashion industry operates under the same model, increasing throughput and number of Seasons. Very very limited clothing is actually designed to be remade, repaired, reused or recycled every second. The equivalent of a rubbish truck of textiles is burnt or buried in landfill. One way to eliminate waste and pollution is through what is known as a circular economy essentially keeping products in use for longer save your wardrobe is a new digital business that has spotted an opportunity to do just that it buttons up so tight that we're going to make it a cropped jacket, so it's going to just above the pockets growing up in Tunisia I was really passionate about seeing how local tailors were able. fast to create new things or repair things and coming to Europe I realized that it was all replaced by fast behaviors of purchasing. I thought let's explore this opportunity using the app. Customers can transform their worn out wardrobes everything about severe wardrobe started because I loved seeing things remade again and again. Our recent research shows that things like circular business models like resale rental repair and remaking have the possibility to be 23 of the global fashion industry by 2030, which represents a market opportunity of 700 billion [UNK] dollars, but there is a risk to all this. Brands could use repair services as green washing without actually helping the planet. If an organization is offering a service like repair, but to use that service they'll give you a voucher off their traditional linear sales. This is incentivizing growth of their linear business model rather than actually. mainstream transition to a circular economy for that business any claims that organizations are making should be really specific and should have very clear definitions attached thank you on May. The 6th 2023. Charles [UNK] will be crowned King of the United Kingdom while all eyes will be on him. Some may glance at his wife Camilla and especially what she chooses to wear on her head. It's said that he wants Queen Camilla to wear the crown that his grandmother wore at her coronation. In 1937. at the center of that Crown sits the Kohinoor Diamond, which was taken from India in 1849 was presented to Queen Victoria, but the idea that this was any real way a gift very much in dispute if she wears it. One expert has said that for Indians this would be a massive diplomatic grenade. In 2023, the Crown's Colonial passed will add. fuel to broader debate over the repatriation of artifacts taken from other countries. The movement in favor of restitution is becoming increasingly strong. People should be allowed to see the art of their own countries in their own countries. Glasgow Life museums will be the first in Britain to return artifacts to India. All seven objects will be going back to New Delhi and they have a museum which is devoted to the display of confiscated or returned artifacts. Our aspiration is to develop strong contemporary Partnerships across the world. We don't think that's possible if we continue to retain objects to which we don't have legal or or moral title and so part of the process is to address some of these these These past mistakes and to to rectify them. The Indian artifacts aren't the only items being sent home. Glasgow is also returning Benin bronzes part of a wider campaign to repatriate these artifacts to what is now Nigeria. The National Commission for Museum and Monuments of Nigeria are acting on behalf of the Uber of Benin. They're trying to build a facility to house all of the returning bronzers. Thousands of bronzers were looted from Benin City when British troops invaded in 1897.. is an artist who is part of the campaign to repatriate them to Nigeria collectively. The Formby Encyclopedia of our history of our culture so in taking them away and locking them involved in various museums all over the world. Except in Africa. It creates a void we can't access as a people. The truths which our ancestors have encoded. Other collections in Britain and around the world have also approved returning bronzes, but restitution remains a controversial subject. The objects may be seen is. Just simply walk some art and therefore, why is there a need to return them? But their spiritual and cultural significance is UH often way more important and if one recognizes that then the return of the object becomes an obvious step to take. There are numerous items in museums across the world that are wanted back by their country of origin. Among the most infamous are the Parthenon Marbles, many of which have been on display in the British Museum. For two centuries a Greek newspaper has revealed the museum has been in talks about their possible return, but there are many legal barriers to restitution, often making it a political decision rather than one solely for the museum trustees, which means it remains to be seen whether the Parthenon Marbles, the Indian Kohinoor diamond, or indeed any other artifacts might make their way home. 2023 is going to. be a huge year for this expect movement on requests from Egypt from Ethiopia from Ghana from the Pacific Islands from Easter Island from Latin America for things to be returned.
